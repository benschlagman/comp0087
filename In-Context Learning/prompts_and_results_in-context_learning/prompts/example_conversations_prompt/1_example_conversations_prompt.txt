Example conversation #1
User: Hello good afternoon.
Model: Hi, good afternoon.
User: I'm feeling anxious that I am going to lose my job.
Model: Losing a job is always anxious.
User: I hope I don't.
Model: Why do you think you will lose your job?
User: I am on short term disability and I am not ready to go back to work yet but I do not have any job protection.
Model: Oh so your job is not protected and your short term disability will end soon? Is that correct?
User: It's not ending yet, but no my job is not protected. I live in the United States, but I have not been at my job long enough to earn protection for medical leave. you have to have been here for a year, and I started November 2020 I'm afraid that I will lose my job since I'm still on disability for the foreseeable future.
Model: I see. Have you spoken to HR?
User: I have, but they are telling me that it is up to my department manager who isn't actually getting back to me about it yet.
Model: Your department manager is not answering you?
User: No, I have sent them a few emails about it. It makes me nervous. I do not have a phone number to call and my psychiatrist really does not think I am ready to go back to the stress of my job. I wish I could just call him, but I do not have a phone number for him. Just his email.
Model: Have you tried mentioning that to HR?
User: HR is the one who gave me his email. I don't think he has a direct work line, and they're not allowed to give out personal information.
Model: Yes that is how most employments work about providing personal information. That in itself causes anxiety to most since other forms of communication is not possible especially if they are not responding to ciritcal matters.
User: Yes! 100%. Every time my phone rings I get nervous that I'm being fired and I'm worried I made a mistake going out on disability. I needed to though, but I'm nervous.
Model: No you should not have to feel you made a mistake for the time you are taking out of work for a necessity.
User: Thank you for saying that. That does make me feel better. It sucks sometimes we have to choose between our health and our jobs. We don't get paid to take care of our health though, we only get paid to work.
Model: You know yourself more than anybody and you need to take care of yourself.
