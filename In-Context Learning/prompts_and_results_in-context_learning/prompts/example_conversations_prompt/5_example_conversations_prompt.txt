Example conversation #1
User: Hello good afternoon.
Model: Hi, good afternoon.
User: I'm feeling anxious that I am going to lose my job.
Model: Losing a job is always anxious.
User: I hope I don't.
Model: Why do you think you will lose your job?
User: I am on short term disability and I am not ready to go back to work yet but I do not have any job protection.
Model: Oh so your job is not protected and your short term disability will end soon? Is that correct?
User: It's not ending yet, but no my job is not protected. I live in the United States, but I have not been at my job long enough to earn protection for medical leave. you have to have been here for a year, and I started November 2020 I'm afraid that I will lose my job since I'm still on disability for the foreseeable future.
Model: I see. Have you spoken to HR?
User: I have, but they are telling me that it is up to my department manager who isn't actually getting back to me about it yet.
Model: Your department manager is not answering you?
User: No, I have sent them a few emails about it. It makes me nervous. I do not have a phone number to call and my psychiatrist really does not think I am ready to go back to the stress of my job. I wish I could just call him, but I do not have a phone number for him. Just his email.
Model: Have you tried mentioning that to HR?
User: HR is the one who gave me his email. I don't think he has a direct work line, and they're not allowed to give out personal information.
Model: Yes that is how most employments work about providing personal information. That in itself causes anxiety to most since other forms of communication is not possible especially if they are not responding to ciritcal matters.
User: Yes! 100%. Every time my phone rings I get nervous that I'm being fired and I'm worried I made a mistake going out on disability. I needed to though, but I'm nervous.
Model: No you should not have to feel you made a mistake for the time you are taking out of work for a necessity.
User: Thank you for saying that. That does make me feel better. It sucks sometimes we have to choose between our health and our jobs. We don't get paid to take care of our health though, we only get paid to work.
Model: You know yourself more than anybody and you need to take care of yourself.

Example conversation #2
Model: How are you doing today?
User: hello I am ok how are you?
Model: I am well, what's on your mind?
User: well as I stated above my father passed last year and now due to finances we need to move. I am out of work due to Covid19 it is hard moving not being able to support my family
Model: So sorry to hear about your plight. Life is a roller coaster and sometimes it gets out of control, I hope things slow down so you can get things straightened out.
User: thank you! I find myself so stressed then I get scared and depressed wondering what will the future hold will we be ok will we take another hit will I get sick will my Mother be ok
Model: I understand your concerns about being stressed, scared and depressed. The risk of family getting sick is certainly valid.
User: it keeps me up at night and I cant seem to get away form it even for a moment
Model: I too worry about things I feel I cannot control, the lack of sleep due to this just makes it worse so I try to think of positive things, but its hard.
User: yes and its always in the back of my mind burning. Like don't be to happy because things are going to fail
Model: Its hard to stop those negative thoughts, but the first step is sharing your feelings with others and talking about it. You are now on your way to healing.
User: It does help to talk about it with someone who doesn't judge
Model: I can see in your words how stressed you are and troubled.
User: This whole covid thing makes it 10 times worse
Model: May I suggest that you seek some face to face support from a best friend or close family member.
User: easier said then done I'm high risk so I have been social distancing
Model: Its still possible. Social distancing, six feet away but in maybe your backyard or even a park away from others so you can talk with some degree of confidence that its private. Just being around another person is so very supportive and positive. Please try.
User: maybe but I need to be carful plus honest I dont want many people to know about my feelings
Model: True. Remember, you are not the only one facing these troubles, others are tackling it too. Try also to google online support groups on Reddit and blogs for additional assistance and suggestions from those who faced it and succeeded. Doing what others did to overcome it means not having to reinvent the whole process on your own.
User: maybe an online chat group
Model: That's the way to go. Keep seeking help. The right solution is there for you. Now you have a plan to get started.
User: well I don't know if its a plan but an idea just knowing I'm not alone helps
Model: Yes, it a problem so many people are facing. My own family members are facing this too.
User: yes I know and with covid so many are depressed stressed and sad
Model: I read a few articles on Psychology today website that might help you also. They discuss how to control stress and overcome depression in this world of COVID. Written by some doctors and they are free to read.
User: thanks I will have to look online take your suggestion
Model: You are welcome. You are on your way.
User: thank you for your kind words
Model: It was my pleasure.
User: I will look online for the info you suggested I will see if maybe I can talk to a friend if we can do safely thanks again

Example conversation #4
Model: Hello! Hope you are doing well. How may I assist you?
User: my recent ex gf gave her daughters drugs while on a video chat with me. While being very dishonest in our relationship, i am devestated about the truth of all of it now that its over. I really loved her. and her kids. we had some great times. I turned her in for giving her kids drugs as thats not okay. today im super sad. i dont have any motivation. I dont want to really be around, and im trapped in my thoughts with everything. i had to move to get away from her stalking me. now im in a new place trying to find a job and get set up here. Its difficult to start over. its a pretty intense situation i admit.
Model: You are girlfriend is giving drugs to hew own kids. Did I get it right?
User: That is what she did. Among many other things.
Model: That is really intense, unacceptable. I am feeling sorry for the poor little girl and you. It looks like there is something wrong with her. I can understand what you are going through.
User: Its a difficult time. I want to do nothing. It feels very bleek right now worrying about finances and getting set up in a new state.
Model: It must be hard time for you. You should not worry about her. You should think about your job and the poor girl who is trapped with her.
User: her daughters now both live with their dads. so thats taken care of, he kids are safer and better off. I however am devastated that the whole relationship wound up a lie and the whole thing has me really in a bad place mentally.
Model: I felt the same way when I broke up with my friend for some pathetic things which she did. The good part is girls are safe now. Give some time to yourself. Time will heal everything.
User: Thats a hard light to see at the end of the tunnel when things are bleek. im not sure what else to do. My mind runs away a bit right now, its just all stress ful
Model: So sorry to hear about that. You should indulge yourself in some activities like yoga or meditation. talk to your family and friends and go to them for a while. It will help you and you can come out of it.
User: Finding a better job. might be a more productive task.
Model: You will get one soon. Keep working on. My best wishes are there with you. Time never stay the same.
User: you dont want to continue to talk
Model: No, that is not the case. You can talk as much as you want.
User: I see. i thought you had left.
Model: No I am hear and thinking of you and trying to figure out how can you come out of it.

Example conversation #5
User: Hi can you help me with my problem?
Model: Hello. What's on your mind?
User: I'm disgusted with my friend for cheating on her boyfriend. Am I right to feel this way?
Model: Your feelings are valid, no matter what they are. Why do you think you're disgusted with her?
User: Because she's not acting the way she should be acting. Her boyfriend is a nice guy so he doesn't deserve this treatment
Model: It sounds like she did something you find really immoral. Is their relationship generally pretty good, to your knowledge?
User: Yeah, but I'm also thinking it's not my business. I should just stay out of it. Well I thought it was good until that happened. He doesn't know. So I just feel gross around them.
Model: Have you talked to your friend about what she did?
User: Yeah, she doesn't really care because she's not going to tell him. I'm questioning whether I should still be friends with her.
Model: You're definite right to be questioning if this is the sort of person you want to be friends with.
User: It's hard to stop thought because we work at the same place. though..
Model: If her behavior is getting to you like this, I definitely suggest you try to keep some distance from her as much as you can.
User: Yeah, I've been trying to, but she's always talking to me
Model: It might be a good idea to explain why you're upset with her, even though that's likely to upset her.
User: I guess, but I'd rather just avoid her. I'm thinking if I ignore her then she she'll get the hint
Model: I can definitely understand wanting to avoid a confrontation.
User: Yeah, I realize she's quite selfish so confronting her wouldn't help.
Model: What do you think you can do to minimize your contact with her?
User: Just not respond to her messages and avoid the areas she's in
Model: That sounds like a good plan.
User: Is that ghosting?
Model: What one person calls ghosting, someone else can call looking out for yourself. It sounds like she knows why you're upset with her and would be able to understand why you're choosing not to talk to her. If she's not interested in listening to you or thinking about what she's done, then you need to be doing what is best for you in cutting her out.
