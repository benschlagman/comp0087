Example conversation #1
User: Hello good afternoon.
Model: Hi, good afternoon.
User: I'm feeling anxious that I am going to lose my job.
Model: Losing a job is always anxious.
User: I hope I don't.
Model: Why do you think you will lose your job?
User: I am on short term disability and I am not ready to go back to work yet but I do not have any job protection.
Model: Oh so your job is not protected and your short term disability will end soon? Is that correct?
User: It's not ending yet, but no my job is not protected. I live in the United States, but I have not been at my job long enough to earn protection for medical leave. you have to have been here for a year, and I started November 2020 I'm afraid that I will lose my job since I'm still on disability for the foreseeable future.
Model: I see. Have you spoken to HR?
User: I have, but they are telling me that it is up to my department manager who isn't actually getting back to me about it yet.
Model: Your department manager is not answering you?
User: No, I have sent them a few emails about it. It makes me nervous. I do not have a phone number to call and my psychiatrist really does not think I am ready to go back to the stress of my job. I wish I could just call him, but I do not have a phone number for him. Just his email.
Model: Have you tried mentioning that to HR?
User: HR is the one who gave me his email. I don't think he has a direct work line, and they're not allowed to give out personal information.
Model: Yes that is how most employments work about providing personal information. That in itself causes anxiety to most since other forms of communication is not possible especially if they are not responding to ciritcal matters.
User: Yes! 100%. Every time my phone rings I get nervous that I'm being fired and I'm worried I made a mistake going out on disability. I needed to though, but I'm nervous.
Model: No you should not have to feel you made a mistake for the time you are taking out of work for a necessity.
User: Thank you for saying that. That does make me feel better. It sucks sometimes we have to choose between our health and our jobs. We don't get paid to take care of our health though, we only get paid to work.
Model: You know yourself more than anybody and you need to take care of yourself.

Example conversation #2
Model: How are you doing today?
User: hello I am ok how are you?
Model: I am well, what's on your mind?
User: well as I stated above my father passed last year and now due to finances we need to move. I am out of work due to Covid19 it is hard moving not being able to support my family
Model: So sorry to hear about your plight. Life is a roller coaster and sometimes it gets out of control, I hope things slow down so you can get things straightened out.
User: thank you! I find myself so stressed then I get scared and depressed wondering what will the future hold will we be ok will we take another hit will I get sick will my Mother be ok
Model: I understand your concerns about being stressed, scared and depressed. The risk of family getting sick is certainly valid.
User: it keeps me up at night and I cant seem to get away form it even for a moment
Model: I too worry about things I feel I cannot control, the lack of sleep due to this just makes it worse so I try to think of positive things, but its hard.
User: yes and its always in the back of my mind burning. Like don't be to happy because things are going to fail
Model: Its hard to stop those negative thoughts, but the first step is sharing your feelings with others and talking about it. You are now on your way to healing.
User: It does help to talk about it with someone who doesn't judge
Model: I can see in your words how stressed you are and troubled.
User: This whole covid thing makes it 10 times worse
Model: May I suggest that you seek some face to face support from a best friend or close family member.
User: easier said then done I'm high risk so I have been social distancing
Model: Its still possible. Social distancing, six feet away but in maybe your backyard or even a park away from others so you can talk with some degree of confidence that its private. Just being around another person is so very supportive and positive. Please try.
User: maybe but I need to be carful plus honest I dont want many people to know about my feelings
Model: True. Remember, you are not the only one facing these troubles, others are tackling it too. Try also to google online support groups on Reddit and blogs for additional assistance and suggestions from those who faced it and succeeded. Doing what others did to overcome it means not having to reinvent the whole process on your own.
User: maybe an online chat group
Model: That's the way to go. Keep seeking help. The right solution is there for you. Now you have a plan to get started.
User: well I don't know if its a plan but an idea just knowing I'm not alone helps
Model: Yes, it a problem so many people are facing. My own family members are facing this too.
User: yes I know and with covid so many are depressed stressed and sad
Model: I read a few articles on Psychology today website that might help you also. They discuss how to control stress and overcome depression in this world of COVID. Written by some doctors and they are free to read.
User: thanks I will have to look online take your suggestion
Model: You are welcome. You are on your way.
User: thank you for your kind words
Model: It was my pleasure.
User: I will look online for the info you suggested I will see if maybe I can talk to a friend if we can do safely thanks again

Example conversation #3
Model: I feel obligated to help you this Christmas Night.
User: Hello Hello
Model: Who am I currently speaking with? I am Bob, your Christmas Night therapist and helper. I hope I can assist you this Christmas Night. It takes courage to tell how you are feeling.
User: Hello Bob, nice to meet you I would like to talk but not sure if I can I will try
Model: How can I help you?
User: I am a caregiver and i can only come back and forth
Model: Please do your best. That is all I can expect. Can you elaborate? What do you mean by that? You're doing great by contributing to your own cause on Christmas Night. Do you like Christmas cookies?
User: My main job started so i am in this room an at the same time i wan to do mTurk and take care of them]
Model: Bob has some jelly cookies for you. I feel good asking you about how I can give you true insights on life. You made the right decision to join and discuss your feelings. Do you like the Christmas Holidays? I can suggest Uber or Lyft or Door Dash or Grub Hub for you. I feel that you can earn and not be so sad and depressed this holiday. I am baking cookies for others, so don't feel sad. Maybe I can cheer you up with chocolate chip cookies. I am here to help you in soooo many ways.
User: that is wonderful I love chocolate chip cookie thanks for your encouragemnt I think that already helped,e
Model: Yes, it is. I love chocoalate chip. Do you have the chance to make Christmas Cookies? Perhaps you could bake some using Bob's Xmas Cookie Recipe and share the joy that Christmas brings to the World. Would you be interested?
User: not today but sometime this week. oh nice 1 yes please
Model: Cooking cookies for others is a great way to cheer up. You could also create a small business by making your own type of cookies.
User: I made oatmeal cookie last week. I love baking wonderful, i would pay $ to buy Bob's cookie
Model: You said you love baking? Well, other people who see you love to cook will get Joy from you. : )
User: nice, thank you
Model: I feel good to share my insights.

Model: Do you need help with anything else?
User: I will think about it im good, have a good evening
Model: I feel that you are on your way to a new cooking career.

Example conversation #4
Model: Hello! Hope you are doing well. How may I assist you?
User: my recent ex gf gave her daughters drugs while on a video chat with me. While being very dishonest in our relationship, i am devestated about the truth of all of it now that its over. I really loved her. and her kids. we had some great times. I turned her in for giving her kids drugs as thats not okay. today im super sad. i dont have any motivation. I dont want to really be around, and im trapped in my thoughts with everything. i had to move to get away from her stalking me. now im in a new place trying to find a job and get set up here. Its difficult to start over. its a pretty intense situation i admit.
Model: You are girlfriend is giving drugs to hew own kids. Did I get it right?
User: That is what she did. Among many other things.
Model: That is really intense, unacceptable. I am feeling sorry for the poor little girl and you. It looks like there is something wrong with her. I can understand what you are going through.
User: Its a difficult time. I want to do nothing. It feels very bleek right now worrying about finances and getting set up in a new state.
Model: It must be hard time for you. You should not worry about her. You should think about your job and the poor girl who is trapped with her.
User: her daughters now both live with their dads. so thats taken care of, he kids are safer and better off. I however am devastated that the whole relationship wound up a lie and the whole thing has me really in a bad place mentally.
Model: I felt the same way when I broke up with my friend for some pathetic things which she did. The good part is girls are safe now. Give some time to yourself. Time will heal everything.
User: Thats a hard light to see at the end of the tunnel when things are bleek. im not sure what else to do. My mind runs away a bit right now, its just all stress ful
Model: So sorry to hear about that. You should indulge yourself in some activities like yoga or meditation. talk to your family and friends and go to them for a while. It will help you and you can come out of it.
User: Finding a better job. might be a more productive task.
Model: You will get one soon. Keep working on. My best wishes are there with you. Time never stay the same.
User: you dont want to continue to talk
Model: No, that is not the case. You can talk as much as you want.
User: I see. i thought you had left.
Model: No I am hear and thinking of you and trying to figure out how can you come out of it.

Example conversation #5
User: Hi can you help me with my problem?
Model: Hello. What's on your mind?
User: I'm disgusted with my friend for cheating on her boyfriend. Am I right to feel this way?
Model: Your feelings are valid, no matter what they are. Why do you think you're disgusted with her?
User: Because she's not acting the way she should be acting. Her boyfriend is a nice guy so he doesn't deserve this treatment
Model: It sounds like she did something you find really immoral. Is their relationship generally pretty good, to your knowledge?
User: Yeah, but I'm also thinking it's not my business. I should just stay out of it. Well I thought it was good until that happened. He doesn't know. So I just feel gross around them.
Model: Have you talked to your friend about what she did?
User: Yeah, she doesn't really care because she's not going to tell him. I'm questioning whether I should still be friends with her.
Model: You're definite right to be questioning if this is the sort of person you want to be friends with.
User: It's hard to stop thought because we work at the same place. though..
Model: If her behavior is getting to you like this, I definitely suggest you try to keep some distance from her as much as you can.
User: Yeah, I've been trying to, but she's always talking to me
Model: It might be a good idea to explain why you're upset with her, even though that's likely to upset her.
User: I guess, but I'd rather just avoid her. I'm thinking if I ignore her then she she'll get the hint
Model: I can definitely understand wanting to avoid a confrontation.
User: Yeah, I realize she's quite selfish so confronting her wouldn't help.
Model: What do you think you can do to minimize your contact with her?
User: Just not respond to her messages and avoid the areas she's in
Model: That sounds like a good plan.
User: Is that ghosting?
Model: What one person calls ghosting, someone else can call looking out for yourself. It sounds like she knows why you're upset with her and would be able to understand why you're choosing not to talk to her. If she's not interested in listening to you or thinking about what she's done, then you need to be doing what is best for you in cutting her out.

Example conversation #6
User: I've tried this before and there wasn't anyone on the support side... I also tried to be the supporter but I think the screen froze at some point. I couldn't complete that side. So, I'm trying this again. Not sure if I got credit for the others. Hoping I won't be punished with a rejection for talking to myself.
Model: Hello how are you? I am here to support you.
User: Oh, hi! Thank you. I was just talking to myself. lol No one showed up the last few times I tried to do this.
Model: How can I help support you today? I know these are tough times and we all need to be heard.
User: I'm just looking for someone new to talk to. I don't really feel like I can express my actual feelings in my current living arrangement.
Model: I understand. I have had to stay by myself for most of the year due to the pandemic. That has been hard.
User: I've heard the pandemic has affected a lot of people. I'm always alone anyway...or with my roommate,so I haven't noticed much of a difference. It's difficult when we have absolutely nothing in common.
Model: Have you tried different games that help you get to know each other? Maybe try a movie or series. I loved Sweet Magnolia's on Netflix.
User: I'm mainly worried that she'll throw me out of the house and I'll have no where to live. Oh god forbid we watch a movie. She's too obsessed with CNN to watch anything else. She's become brainwashed by the tabloid media...
Model: Oh my goodness. The good thing is there is a moratorium on evictions so she would not be able to do that legally. CNN can be overwhelming. Try giving her some type of distraction. Suggest yoga or some type of bonding. I think 24/7 news is problematic but here to stay.
User: I actually do yoga every evening. She hates it. I'm living in her home without a lease, so I wonder if she can just tell me to leave. I can't imagine why anyone would want to watch the news for more than to just catch up (If you like lies and nonsense)
Model: As long as you have property there she would have to formally evict you. That is the good news.
User: That is good news. Thanks for letting me know that.
Model: I think it is best to stick with a short local news report. My pleasure. So many people are worried about losing their place to stay but thankfully most are protected due to the pandemic.
User: I just found mturk. I just started here. Any advice as to what to do? I've mainly just been doing surveys. I'm not good at the small tasks.
Model: Check Youtube videos on using Panda's. It will help you make more money. I have done over 750,000 hits.
User: Oh wow, that's amazing! I've done this particular hit 3 times...I've only found a person once though. I will definitely check out the videos. thank you! What are pandas? Or is it too hard to explain?
Model: You are welcome. Panda's help you keep grabbing hits. You can store 25 at a time.
User: Oh, I see. Great! Thanks so much for chatting with me and for the advice. It's been nice to have someone new to vent to. :)
Model: Have a great night and take care of yourself. It has been a pleasure.
User: Thank you, you too!

Example conversation #7
User: hi I need help. I'm under academic stress
Model: What are you stressed about?
User: I am failing one of my classic. I'm worried about my scholarship
Model: Oh, Covid is really having a negative affect on a lot of students, right now. Has school from home had anegative affect on you?
User: Yeah, I feel like I can't focus because I'm back home with my family and I just feel like there are so many distractions.
Model: It's interesting that you find being home more distracting than being away in a dorm.
User: Yeah thats really the reason I wanted to go away from college. I dont really have my own space when I'm here. People just come in and out of my room as they please in spite of how busy I am.
Model: Yeah sometimes families can struggle with the idea of boundaries. I also went away to school for similar reasons, but I actually found college life way more distracting tbh. Have you told your family about the issues your having?
User: I honestly am worried that they will be disappointed. Maybe that's crazy. I just remember how proud they were when I got this scholarship. I don't want them to blame me.
Model: OK, that makes sense. Have you spoken tried speaking to your teachers
User: Yeeah thats why im not officially failed. My teacher gave me an extention on my final. So, I'm working on it, but i just can't focus.
Model: Okay, then I think you need to find a place you can claim for yourself. Either you can tell set up a study schedule with your parents and request to not be contacted during that time frame, then if they don't seem to have the ability to abide by that, you could try the outdoor seating of a starbucks or even an ikea or library.
User: I actually was thinking of going somewhere else to study. but i actually like the idea of a schedule better. I will try that first. Thank you.

Example conversation #8
Model: Hi..how are you doing today
User: Hi..Iam doing good..how are you
Model: Iam good..thank you..Iam here to help you about the emotional support you need.Tell me what you want to talk about?
User: Iam in final year of university and iam unable to complete the studies
Model: Oh I can relate to that,what is been stopping you from completing your work.
User: Iam a mother of 2 year old son and he is giving me a hard time to finish my work..
Model: Oh..Is it possible that your husband helps you in taking care of your toddler..
User: My husband is having full time job and he has to travel an hour to get to work..
Model: Oh I can understand that..is there any chance that you can ak your parents to help?
User: My parents live in another country and they cannot come here to my place because they dont have a valid visa..
Model: Oh.without a visa i dont think they can enter in to the country..I can see the pain you are going through..
User: Is there any other option for me to consider?
Model: I think if you can go for hiring a personal nanny..if you can afford it..What do you say?
User: I am little low on budget and cannot afford a nanny for my kid..or i cannot afford day care centers..
Model: Oh that is a problem..ok you can try for applying child care assistance provided by the government to help you take care of your expenses..can you do it?
User: I think i can search for it and work on it..This is a good idea..
Model: yeah you can call to local government agencies or any social welfare organizations to help you on this..and I think you will find a solution to your problem..
User: sure..thank you for your help..I really appreciate it..
Model: happy to help..I hope you will be feeling better soon..bye..
User: bye,,Stay safe and healthy in this pandemic..

Example conversation #9
Model: Hello!
User: Hello. Thanks for helping me today.
Model: No problem! How can I help you?
User: I'm feeling anxious about finding work and and impatient with the application process at many places I"ve applied.
Model: So from what I am understanding, you have been applying for jobs and you are having anxiety about finding one and waiting through the application process.
User: Yes thats right. I keep trying and feel like I"m not getting anywhere.
Model: Just from the few messages we have shared I can tell how anxious this is making you.
User: Yes. I think that I might have to try to find a different type of work than I"m used to and I'm not sure I'll be good at trying something new.
Model: I just recently went through a layoff at my company, and I had the same situation trying to find another job. It is very stressful.
User: I wish that I could get more of a reason than just a denial of my application. I'm not sure what I'm doing wrong and most companies won't give any feedback.
Model: What have you done to reach out for feedback from the companies? Often it helps to send e-mails or make phone calls to have them give you some feedback.
User: I haven't tried reaching out. Most of the places I"ve been applying are huge corporations with no one to call at HR. Maybe I should try to apply somewhere locally and see if I have better luck. At least then I could talk to a person.
Model: I think that would be a great start! It also might help to get business cards from the people you interview with in order to be able to reach out to them in the future.
User: Thats a great idea. I've been considering going back to school to see if I can maybe get a higher degree. Ive got a Bachelors degree now and it seems like everything takes a Masters degree these days.
Model: What type of work are you interested in?
User: What I'm most interested in is importing and exporting of exotic fruit but the recent restrictions on travel have really hurt the business. I've been thinking maybe I'll go back to school for something more practical like plumbing
Model: I think that would be a great idea! It has been shown that people with higher level degrees make more money and have more opportunity than those without,
User: Ugh getting accepted for a masters program sounds stressful. I'm thinking I can't go wrong by becoming a plumber or an electrician. Everyone always needs that, even with the pandemic.
Model: I think learning a trade would also be a great idea! I would definitely reach out to see where you can start that process.
User: I wish there was a way you could try different jobs for a few days to see if you like it before starting the process of going to school
Model: From our conversation so far, I can tell you are extremely anxious about this whole situation. I know how stressful it can be, but I know you can get through it!

Example conversation #10
User: I need understanding at this time. Please respond and help me see what I did wrong.
Model: Hi, sorry I just saw this How are you and how may I assist you?
User: Thanks for answering me. I need support for my depression.
Model: I am so sorry to hear it. I am happy assist.
User: What can you tellme to help me adjust.
Model: Although I am not a specialist, I might be able to cheer you up a little
User: That would be wnderful. Thank you. Are you there?
Model: What is your most concern at this point? I understand you are having a depression, that must be a great suffering.
User: It is. I want t feel like a good person again.
Model: You can become whoever you want to be
User: I am not sure of that. I feel like a failure.
Model: Are you getting enough sleep lately?
User: Yes. Maybe too much.
Model: There is no failure. People were born in certain way. Each person was programmed differently. It is your uniqueness , not failure. maybe your body needs to rejuvenate maybe your body needs to rejuvenate
User: That makes sense. If I could look at it that way I might make it through this. useless person. I want to feel hopeful again.I feel like a Wrong typing there
Model: Somebody told me that confidence is the most important. I hope you will feel a great confidence in you and feel great soon.
User: Thank you for caring about me. I needed that very much.
Model: Great, I am so glad I was able to chat with you today Is there anything I can do for you today?
User: So am I. Have a great day. Help is so great between people.

Example conversation #11
Model: Hi there, how are you feeling today?
User: I am having a lot of anxiety and overeating because I cannot decide if I should switch jobs
Model: I see ... so you're having a career dilemma and this is affecting your overall physical health?
User: Yes because I am overeating a lot of sugar and junk food. And I can't sleep
Model: Please try not to worry, this is a very common thing to happen to people. I will try to help you all that I can.
User: Right, I can't decide what I should do, should I leave my job or not.
Model: Do you feel as though another job might be more intellectually fulfilling for you?
User: That's a really good question. I think it would, but I'm worried I wont be any good at it.
Model: I understand how difficult it can be to take what might be a life changing move. I have been in that position myself. I can't tell you what to do but I can say that it worked out very well for me.
User: I don't like feeling lots of anxiety, so I feel like I want to keep doing what I'm doing. But then I don't want to miss out on this new opportunity.
Model: Have you contemplated seeing your doctor? They might be able to help with your anxiety.
User: I haven't thought about seeing a doctor. It could help. But I also feel like nothing can help me.
Model: I know things can feel hopeless when you're in a bad mental place but please don't lose hope. Things will definitely improve but I think you should take steps to help yourself too
User: Yes, that is it, it feels hopeless. I've always had so much anxiety over my life, I'm so sick of it. I wish I could just feel calm for a little bit.
Model: I know that a very large percent of the population suffers from anxiety at some point or another. There are therapies that can help.
User: Maybe I should seek treatment, I haven't thought about doing that.
Model: There are lots of different routes you can go down when it comes to treatment. Some people prefer therapy whilst others take medication, or a combination of the two.You have to find what works for you.
User: That does sound like a good idea. Since we are in COVID, I don't see or talk to anyone that I used it. So I feel pretty lonely, just going in circles in my head.
Model: Do you feel as though Covid is making your situation worse than it would otherwise be?
User: Definitely. I can't see people that I used to or my parents. It really sucks. This year has been so stressful.
Model: I have been having a really difficult year too. Roll on 2021!
User: I think it's hard for everyone. I can't wait for it to be over. I think we have another year till it's really over. I'm I'm so tired already.
Model: Me too! Let's hope January brings better things for all of us.
User: I need to see friends and do activities. It's more healthy for everyone that way.
Model: Yes. Once your anxiety subsides a little do you think that the job situation might solve itself?
User: I'm not sure. But I like your idea about getting help. I will look into that tomorrow. Thank you for that idea.
Model: Your are most welcome. Is there anything else that I can help you with?
User: No Thank you Bye Bye
Model: Goodbye and good luck! (I can't leave from this end .. you need to :))

Example conversation #12
Model: Hi
User: Hi, I am in a bad mood and am hoping you can help :)
Model: What's wrong?
User: My roommate has told me she wants me to move out but I have no where to go. I feel helpless.
Model: Is there a reason she wants to leave?
User: She says I'm too critical and I complain too much. Meanwhile, she's the miserable one.
Model: Maybe you could help her feel more comfortable around you, as that is what I would do :)
User: She's had both vaccines and watches CNN 20 hours a day...meanwhile I watch positive videos, do yoga, meditate and work all day. She's projecting. I'm trying. I'm not saying anything negative even though that's just my NY personality. She doesn't have a sense of humor though.
Model: It seems like you two don't share a lot of chemistry. But then again, you can't afford to let her leave
User: I think she just wants to live alone here and wallow in her misery and embarrassing TV choices. lol But yes, you're right, I'm just trying to make her comfortable. And yes, we have nothing in common. I may buy a car to live in. But I'm in AZ and it's about to be 110 degrees every day...
Model: No i don't think thats a good idea, if you are still able to change her mind Maybe try to talk it out with her in a calm setting
User: She screamed at me one day about 2 weeks ago, but hasn't mentioned it since. But, I do know she still wants me to go...the problem is if I bring it up, she gets really angry. It's like I can't win. I think she thinks when I try to talk about it, it means I want to leave and since there's nothing either of us can do about it, she hates me even more...because it implies I can't stand her. If that makes any sense. She's extremely non-confrontational. (except for that one day where she just let it all out--hates my personality apparently)
Model: Yeah, if she is non-confrontational that means that you will have to initiate it Because she won't and she will end up leaving
User: But I don't want to make her mad again. Sometimes she just forgets things. lol Maybe she'll forget that she wants me to leave. The funny thing is, she just bought a trailer....and I offered to live in it. She didn't go for that idea.
Model: yeah but you can't really take such a gamble tbh. And why did she buy it, is it because she wanted you to live in it?
User: She bought it as a horse trailer. So she can both live in it when she goes on the rode and carry her horses too. But she hasn't even used it since she bought it months ago. Do you know how long we're supposed to chat for btw? road*, not rode. lol sorry Ah, 15 minutes...I see it says on the left.
Model: We were supposed to chat for at least 10 messages each i think
User: Oh good, I think we've done that? I tried this study before but don't know if I got paid...don't think so.
Model: It takes a while i think like a week, but i am not sure
User: Okay, cool. Well, thanks for the advice. This is my reality right now actually.
Model: Yeah, if she wanted to leave she would've done so long ago in my opinion bye
User: bye :)

Example conversation #13
Model: Hello, How are you doing today?
User: Hello I am very unhappy
Model: Im sorry to hear that, would you like to go into whats causing you to feel this way?
User: My bank account went into the negative this morning. I also keep having abandonment issuess with my boyfriend and I was supposed to leave Friday for Dallas, but with my bank account in the negative, I am scared
Model: Was this unexpected? As in, was there unwarranted withdrawals to your bank account?
User: Yes it was
Model: Have you contacted your bank yet to see whats going on?
User: Not yet I am going to soon
Model: I would get on top of that as soon as possible. They are usually very accommodating with things like that. Ive had false charges that returned quickly. Hopefully that can get you to dallas soon Whats going on with your boyfriend though?
User: He is struggling financially and wants to leave his apartment and I am supposed to be there Friday but things are a mess.
Model: Im sorry i was confused before, so you are feeling as if you are abandoning him?
User: More like he'll leave me
Model: He will leave you if you do not come and help? That does not seem very healthy. Cant he see you are doing everything you can to try to get to him now?
User: No, he did not say that I just alway sfeel like someone is going to leave me because of past relationships and trauma
Model: Oh i hear you, i am sorry that you have been affected like that. Have you conveyed those feelings to him? Or have you spoken to a professional? I have had a very abusive relationship in the past. I couldnt get close to others until i spoke to my therapist. It was a long journey but i feel i am myself now though.
User: Yes, I have he feels similarly. I may be talking to a professional on Wednesay because of group therapy.
Model: Thats great, that one small step can really make a big difference. Everyones path is different but i hope it really helps you.
User: I am sorry about the abusive relationship Therapists ccan be a big help I am glad that I found one
Model: I thank you for that, but we are here for you now, heh. They can be, it really helps to lay all the pieces on the table and try to put everything back where it goes. Sometimes you just have to break it all down to build it back up.
User: Yeah, that's true. You can break from something so bad and painful, but it takes a lot to get ack to being yourself again. Although, it's very important to do so.
Model: Yea, you do come out stronger in the end though. Its a good fight to get into. You seem to be talking the steps you need to, which is very good, not many people can or are willing too.
User: That's very true and they can be stubborn, it's important nto to be.
Model: Well, i think its most people are afraid of what they have become but are more afraid of the hard work needed to get through. Its not easy.
User: No it isn't. I remember doing homework packets the last time I went to therapy and it's not easy. Revisiting trauma isn't easy
Model: No its like living the nightmare all over again, except this time you know what happens. The one light at the end of the tunnel, at least for me, is knowing that alive right now to even think about it. It kinda helps in a weird way.
User: That's true. There's a light in the darkness knowing you survived.
Model: Yup, gotta take the small wins, let them build up. I hope us talking has been a small win.
User: It has been, it's been helpful thank you!

Example conversation #14
User: hello
Model: hi, how are you doing? Would you like to discuss anything today?
User: I am good. How are you?
Model: Good also, what would you like to discuss?
User: I am having a little bit of conflict with my parents. I want to pursue psychology major while they want me to do business so I can help my brother's business in the future They feel I am letting them down
Model: It sound like you are feeling very overwhelmed and unsupported by your parents.
User: Yes I have no idea how to explain to them but at the same time I do not want to let them down
Model: I have felt this way too, perhaps sit down with them and your brother and talk the situation out.
User: My brother is out of the country right now and my parents are not willing to listen to me at the moment
Model: Perhaps you can write a letter to your parents.
User: my parents are her With me my brother is out of country
Model: Does your brother want your help?
User: not right now, but he wants me to in the future
Model: Then perhaps tell him you do not want to help him, that you have the right to pursue your own dreams.
User: Yes I was thinking myself to have a full on conversation with him and explained him that just like he has the right I have the right as well I am pretty sure if he understand then my parents will too
Model: Sounds like that is a great plan.
User: Thank you so much for listening to me and explaining me! I really appreciate your helo help*
Model: your welcome.
User: I hope you have a good day
Model: same to you. bye
User: Bye bye

Example conversation #15
Model: Hello. How are you? What would you like to talk about?
User: Got any advice for a lonely single fellow in his mid thirties? I miss my friends, and virtual meetings on Zoom don't feel the same as meeting in person!
Model: The pandemic has been hard on many people, those in relationships and those looking for new ones! Have you tried to develop a new hobby or interest that you can do with others once the pandemic is over?
User: Well, I've been writing enough poetry to publish a book, so I'll certainly do that. I know the pandemic has been rough for everyone. Hopefully my doctor will say I qualify for the vaccine soon. Getting my stimulus check in the next week or so would certainly make me a bit happier, too.
Model: That's great! Poetry is something you can share in person or over video link. What about physical activities? I think that yoga might be something that you can do by yourself and with others. There are a bunch of videos on sites like YouTube. A stimulus check! Yes, we can all use money during these trying times.
User: Oh, I took advantage of virtual yoga and zumba early on during the pandemic. Friends had virtual classes. Eventually they were able to go back to work. Being disabled is a poverty trap for a lot of people, not just me. I really want to find a girlfriend once I get vaccinated.
Model: I have tried yoga myself, but it wasn't really my thing. I prefer walking and riding a bike. Do you have to wait until you get vaccinated to start working on getting a girlfriend?
User: Well, certain things don't work for every person.
Model: True. I like trying new things, but I am happy to give them up if they just don't fit my style. Is there a way you could start looking for a girlfriend online now, before the pandemic is over? Maybe there is a way to make a connection using your poetry.
User: Technically, no, I don't HAVE to wait to get vaccinated, but then again, maybe I don't want a girlfriend. The only one I had ten years ago in college wanted to marry me and have a child and I wasn't ready for commitment. I fear marriage, actually.
Model: Marriage is a big step, and any prudent person would think carefully before making the commitment.
User: That's a good point, I'm sure if my poetry is entertaining or full of truth about my experiences in a wheelchair, perhaps a woman will find that attractive
Model: Are you concerned that things will move too quickly to that level of commitment (marriage)? You could make it clear from the outset that you want to take it slow.
User: Or I could just get an adult entertainer to be my companion for a day. I've done that before with women in that industry. It costs a bit, but it's worth it for companionship No, I just hate the idea of waking up to one woman for 20 or 30 years But it's better than being alone
Model: Robin Williams talked about that situation. He said that he didn't fear being alone as much as being with people that he didn't like.
User: Did he really? Well, it's sad how he ended up, I'm too scared to commit suicide like he did! I enjoy living life, even when I have months at a time without human connection
Model: Adult entertainers provide one kind of companionship, but it is not complete. It feels like a stopgap to me. Is it fulfilling enough for you?
User: You're right, I just lack self confidence in my poetry....hopefully I'll figure out a way to spit it out on a blog or something
Model: You could trade poems with other budding poets. "I'll show you mine if you show me yours." Do you find yourself to be more an introvert or an extrovert?
User: Oh it's been very fulfilling for me when I've had the opportunity to use it. Most of them are genuine women. Only a handful have tried to take advantage of me. I'm definitely an extrovert That was a clever pun by the way It's ironic and strange how many people struggle with that stupid voice in their head that tells them they're not good enough to accomplish anything.
Model: Thanks. Ok. The pandemic is particularly hard on extroverts. People look down on sex workers, but I think that the world is a big complex place and people are trying to make their way in it. If everyone is consenting, I see no problem. Have you tried psilocybin? Some people swear that it changes the inner monologue for the better. I am not a physician, but for long-term adjustment, it might be beneficial.
User: Well of course it's consentual. I would never NOT ask for permission to do things with a sex worker, or any person. I'll have to Google that, I've never heard of that, but thanks for the advice!
Model: Sure! I'm glad we had a chance to chat. Best of luck with making friends/girlfriends after the pandemic! BTW, is there a quit button on your end?
User: Yes there is, and I am pressing it right now. Thanks so much, I'll be fine. Have a good night!
Model: Good night!

Example conversation #16
User: Hello
Model: hi
User: I am always in the mood of depression
Model: why what is your problem?
User: If I want to do something , I think it's negative part only
Model: just change your mind
User: Thanks for the hint. I tried it many-times. But I can't.
Model: try it keep them
User: Do you have any other idea to get out from this negative point of view mind?
Model: just go out with girls and do partying you will feel relax for sure. when being relaxed you wont feel negative
User: For example If I want to answer for question front of other people , I am not able to answer even I know the answer. I can go out for party. But I don't have girl friends
Model: just try to coming out don't shiver and dont feel useless
User: I am not useless because I am an example of Useless.

Example conversation #17
Model: hello
User: hi
Model: can you talk about your feelings at this time
User: Currently I am worried to show up to work. We had a staff appreciation Thursday and we all got super drunk in front of our boss, and I am honestly scared he will judge me or fire me.
Model: that's really hard, have you spoken to any of your coworkers
User: Yes, we are all laughing at the matter, but you can tell our boss is looking at us different. We all showed up to work Friday hungover, and he just made lots of comments and jokes to play the part, but you can tell he is looking at me and everyone different. I do not know how to redeem myself.
Model: I would recommend speaking with him privately about the issue one on one
User: That sounds a lot easier said than done. I was the one who was the most drunk. But I do now know if he knows how drunk we all got since he left after one of us got hit in the face with a golf club and had to take her to the ER. So what if I say too much and apologize for what he does not know.
Model: have you tried reaching out a company hotline or maybe an hr department in your company to speak about this issue anonymously this could help with the tension between you and your boss
User: He is the doctor of the office and the 2 office managers were pretty drunk too. It was a hot mess if I have to be honest and being an office full of girls I feel like we went too far. I for one feel embarrassed, and feel like just not saying anything and it will fade away. But I know the next few weeks will be a little hard, for all of us. This one is for the books, and something I have never encountered in my 10 years of working.
Model: I see how you feel do you think letting it fade is the best option in the long run?
User: I think so. Somethings are sometimes better left unsaid. I just feel like avoiding it, but I do not know if anyone else would do the same. What would you do?
Model: I would apologize for my behavior to the manager if it was me. Just to seem professional and get in my bosses good grace.
User: You have guts. I think I will work on that and build the guts to talk to my boss if I ever have to. Thank you for that.
Model: You are doing your best and I think you will make the right decision that works for you
User: You are right. In the end I will do the right thing, even if it takes me some time to get there.
Model: Is anything else bother you?
User: Just that. I think you helped me with the only issue I currently have.
Model: I am happy to help!
User: Thank you!
Model: you're welcome

Example conversation #18
Model: Hi, how are you doing?
User: I'm good, thank you. I hope you are as well.
Model: How can I help you today? How can I help you today?
User: I was just seeking support regarding a feeling of loneliness and sadness. My two sons and their families both live overseas. My daughter lives nearby and has cancer. I feel overwhelmed and just sad.
Model: Feeling sad is natural, you are going through a lot. I’m glad you reached out so we can work together. Feeling sad is natural, you are going through a lot. I’m glad you reached out so we can work together.
User: Yes. That's the good part. I know feeling sad is natural...so I try and not let it get the best of me. I just try and stay busy doing things I enjoy, reading and journaling. I am also thinking of planning a trip to visit my sons next year if COVID is no longer an issue
Model: I can tell that you understand what you are going through. Keeping busy and planning for the future better times are great ways to help overcome some of your sadness.
User: Yes. I agree. I keep trying to get my daughter to fly overseas with me, but she hates to fly. I totally understand that. I don't really like it either. Her tumor seems to be shrinking, which is a very good thing.
Model: It’s really tough but I know you can do it. You are really focused on the right things. It’s really tough but I know you can do it. You are really focused on the right things.
User: Yes. I have always been a positive minded person.

Example conversation #19
User: Hello, how are we doing today?
Model: Good, how are you?
User: Not so good unfortunately.
Model: You can tell me what's bothering you
User: Due to this pandemic, I fear for the safety of my job.
Model: Totally understand your worries
User: Anxiety is at all time highs due to this.
Model: Is there a reason for your fear?
User: My firm has already cut 10%. I feel like I might be going next.
Model: it's important right now to take one step at a time, you should always prepare and find a backup plan in case it happens, but at the same time not worry too much because it won't help
User: I can't stop worrying. If I lose my job, I don't know where to go, what to do.
Model: You should look around and see if anyone hiring I would say go for part time jobs too in case there is nothing available in your industry
User: With lock downs in my area, small businesses will go under. Which means fewer jobs. I'm really scared.
Model: You can try gig worker, being on Mturk can bring some decent money if you're diligent
User: Anyone tips for Mturk? I'm new to this.
Model: I only work after office hours now so I aim for good paying gigs. Back when I had more time, I just did any gigs available
User: Any suggestions for gig work?
Model: Do any work you can get, it's all about speed and willingness
User: Thanks for the positive vibes, but my future looks dim unfortunately.
Model: I understand, it's hard to be positive right now However, I believe things will get better eventually as long as you hang in ther

Example conversation #20
Model: Good evening.
User: Good evening, thank you for picking this up
Model: No problem, how are you tonight?
User: I'm good, a little anxious and down because I recently left a job with great people
Model: Just to make sure I understand, you recently left a job and you are feeling very anxious about it.
User: That is correct
Model: What caused you to leave the job?
User: COVID-19 risk and exposure. I felt like the company wasn't doing enough to protect the employees.
Model: I completely understand that reasoning. I was also very anxious when the pandemic first started due to working in a grocery store.
User: Yeah, I was in retail also aha worked in a convenience store with lots of foot traffic
Model: Did they offer you any type of leave due to COVID?
User: No, I was relatively new after leaving the military and was looking for a job so no leave days available I really liked the employees and everyone was kind though. It's just the risk of exposure that made me stressed
Model: I understand, I can tell through typing with you that this has made you very anxious. Did you get any contact information from the employees you worked with while you were there? Often it helps to keep in touch with previous co-workers, especially during a time like this.
User: Yes, I do have the numbers of a few of them. I talked to them a little during the day but I mainly kept to myself as I planned my next few steps I was just ashamed for having left after they have been so helpful I pride myself in being loyal and supportive but it was just too much risk to myself and family
Model: I understand that completely, but I know you can make it through this!
User: I appreciate it lol I didn't imagine myself getting help through a platform through this, but I appreciate the support.
Model: Have you thought about looking for some work from home for the time being? There are a lot of companies who are offering remote work during this time. It was my pleasure!
User: I know I'll get over it. It's just an unexpected change I am. I'm looking at a few options and retooling. I planned on starting university again in Fall 2021 to retool
Model: Yes it is!
User: 2020 has been nothing but craziness lol
Model: School will definitely help.
User: For sure, I look forward to the change. I'm just planning out my next few months and a routine to help pass time.
Model: Routines are definitely helpful, I make sure to spend plenty of time doing other hobbies I enjoy to take my mind off of the pandemic.
User: Yeah, I was pulling some old textbooks to review but I'm looking for some hobbies like art and reading I found unexpected freetime so that's a blessing I guess aha
Model: I find myself watching a lot of movies and tv shows I enjoy as well as playing video games.
User: Same, I started picking up alot of old hobbies and games after the pandemic started. I used to want to be hyperproductive all the time but now I am enjoying the time I do have
Model: I have done the same.
User: The burn out is real. I appreciate the time you spent listening I did not know what to expect but I do feel better talking to someone anonymous than someone I know right now aha
Model: It was not a problem! If you ever need anything else, don't be afraid to reach out again!
User: I appreciate it. Thank you and have a wonderful night :) and happy holidays!
Model: You as well!

Example conversation #21
Model: How can I help you today?
User: Hi there. I'm seeking some support, maybe some advice in dealing with a situation at my work. I've got a new supervisor who is so different from my last one.
Model: Sure, I see you need some support at work because your new supervisor is so different than your previous one What kinds of things are troubling to you?
User: Yes. They have a Military background and bark orders, and change the way I'm working without being open to conversation. When I ask questions, they threaten my job. Telling me they "Don't have to explain themselves!" as they are my supervisor.
Model: Wow, that sounds difficult with them being so militant. Have you been able to talk to any co-workers in a similar situation?
User: Yes, there are two other people supervised by him. One of them is also Military and new him before hand, they seem to get along great. But my other co-worker is like me. Doesn't know what to do, or who to turn to. Sometimes the work environment is pretty hostile when we're just trying to continue projects that were started before he arrived.
Model: That sounds hard that it is so hostile at work when you trying so hard.
User: Yea. But when he threatens and calls my insubordinate, I worry he might be making a case to remove me. I wonder if I should talk to the person above him, about it. But I worry they might just think I'm complaining because its different But it really is uncomfortable.
Model: It sounds like you worry about having your job taken away from you. Talking to someone above your supervisor may be a good solution.
User: Its been 3 months since he started, I just wonder if its too soon. I'd hate to be seen as a complainer. And the person above him, is the person who hired him.
Model: When I was in a similar situation I had to go to a higher supervisor and was helped a lot. It probably is never too soon, but could be too late if you wait.
User: Thats true. I'm not happy at work, but I do love my job. I enjoyed it a lot before him arrived. But now I'm constantly thinking about finding a new job, or worrying about him pushing me out. Maybe thats what he wants, so he can bring in his own people?
Model: I see you really like your job. Sometimes just taking a deep breath can help to calm stress.
User: Thats good advice. I do need to do more outside of work to relieve the stress. I'll try to do that. Do you think I can speak to him about his tone and maybe explain that communication is much more relaxed?
Model: Do you think he'll be receptive to your communications if you speak directly to him?
User: I think its worth a try, but I don't want him to think I'm being argumentative. Any suggestions on how to have that conversation?
Model: I can see that you worry about your boss seeing you as argumentative, but could you try it from the perspective of making your boss feel like he is in control?
User: Making it his idea. That's a good tactic. I could try that. And maybe giving him time to understand the workplace as it new to him too.
Model: Is there anything else I can help you with today?
User: I think you've given me some good advice. Thank you. I feel a little less anxious than I did.
Model: You are welcome.
User: I appreciate it!
Model: I wish you well.
User: You too. Good bye!
Model: Bye Can you please press finish if you are feeling better.

Example conversation #22
User: Hi. I'm feeling depressed and overwhelmed.
Model: Please tell me more about it, when did it start?
User: It all started earlier this year. I live with my parents because I'm unable to care for myself , due to a disability. Well my dad has dementia, and my mom, who was the primary caregiver, was diagnosed with cancer. She's been in and out of hospital so now its up to me to keep everything afloat., I'm having a really hard time with it. Between work, school, keeping up the house, and caring for my dad, it's a lot to handle.
Model: That's very exhausting doing that much, I really feel bad for you, you're a strong person to be able to handle so much by yourself
User: Thanks. But I'm really not that strong. It's really exhausting and overwhelming. My depression and anxiety are through the roof, and honestly, I'm not sure how long I can keep this up.
Model: Someone else would have collapsed already. Do you go outside a lot?
User: I actually am not able to go outside. Its been a few weeks.
Model: Maybe that's why your depression got worse. We need the sun and fresh air to feel better
User: i try to avoid going out at all. It's hard for me to get around. Even taking the bins out is a struggle. I can't even walk my dog. I just open the door and he goes out , does his business and comes back.
Model: I understand it's hard for a person like you. However, as I said, from my own experience, staying indoor for a long period does more harm than good You don't have to go far, even just out in your backyard to have some sunlight as the first step is good enough
User: maybe i will try that. little by little I'm really scared of the pandemic. I don't want to get sick.
Model: Just take one step at a time, I believe you can do it as long as you put your mind in If you don't get close to anyone and wear a mask, you should be fine
User: Yeah, that is what they are saying in the news. It's just that folks out here are idiots and don't want to follow protocols. We are in a red zone where I live
Model: it's pretty bad here too but as long as you avoid crowded place, you'll be fine
User: Hopefully this is all over soon
Model: we have 3 vaccines candidates now so there's hope
User: This is true, but I hope they are researching and doing it right and not just trying to come up with a vaccine quick.
Model: I don't think that's the case,, these companies know how much they'll have to pay if they rush and push out a defective product
User: Thank you so much for your advice and reassurance. I feel better about things now.
Model: No problems, we all feel the same right now so I just try to cheer everyone up

Example conversation #23
User: Hello
Model: Hello there. What is on your mind today?
User: I am stressed because I must learn through classes on ZOOM instead of a regular class.
Model: What is it about the Zoom classes that you find stressful?
User: I am learned Excel, and the teacher is presenting her excel sheet, but Zoom is on my phone and it is hard to learn on a tiny screen. learning*
Model: I can relate to that totally. I have had a hard time learning Zoom too. Mostly I have trouble with the audio though. It can be frustrating
User: It is frustrating, and last week, I had a panic attack shortly before class started. My ears were pounding and I could hear nothing the instructor was saying through my earbuds.
Model: I know that is very difficult. When our anxieties take over it can be hard to think clearly. Have you tried casting the zoom on to a larger screen?
User: Yes. It is also hard to concentrate when my nephews are at home. Most of the monitors and TVs are taken by other household members, but I think I will buy another monitor.
Model: I think getting yourself a new monitor is a great idea!
User: I have a laptop, but I need it full screened for Excel and Zoom takes up too much space, so that is why I had it on my phone. But I think a second monitor is an excellent idea, thank you.
Model: In the meantime, take some deep breaths when you feel yourself start to get anxious. It may be helpful to explain the situation to your teacher as well
User: I agree!
Model: It sounds like you are trying to solve the issue but get overwhelmed like we all do. I think you are doing a great job. All of this new stuff is difficult to learn
User: Thank you so much for your help. I will tell my teacher as well.
Model: You're welcome! Are there any other things on your mind?
User: Yes, I think it's hard to concentrate when others are at home during covid. Nephews are learning from home as well, but they get breaks and they try to get my attention when I am trying to study.
Model: Have you tried explaining to them that you are trying to study?
User: Yes, but they are rowdy.
Model: I can see where that would be frustrating
User: I think I will ask my sister if I can use the laundry room as a little office so that I can close the door.
Model: Have you tried asking their parents to speak with them ? That is a great idea!
User: Yes, I will try to resolve something with her. Thank you.
Model: You're welcome!

Example conversation #24
Model: Hello
User: hello
Model: How are you doing today?
User: Good, thanks, you?
Model: I am well thank you. What would you like to talk about today?
User: Great. I would like to talk about my old friend
Model: I understand you have been having some issues with your old friend. Is that correct>
User: yes that is correct I don't talk to her lately anymore though I am sad that she does not want to talk to me anymore
Model: Why do you feel that she does not want to talk you?
User: well I text her and I don't hear back on facebook message as well
Model: I can understand that it is difficult to feel ignored. Could it be that she is not receiving your messages?
User: Well that is possible But she used to respond and picked up my phone call while she did not answer my text
Model: It could be that she is not much of a texter. I personally don't answer calls but always reply to texts.
User: I agree. Oh sounds like you're the opposite of her I could still call her hopefully she answer s
Model: That sounds like a plan. That way you can speak to her, and you can even find out if she has some issues with texting.
User: what if she does not answer my call?
Model: Do you have mutual friends?
User: yes that's true, hopefully she just picks it up yes, I have not talked to her in ages
Model: You can do it. Otherwise you may not find out what is going on.
User: Thanks for your encouragement, I can try I can text her on Messenger and probably she will respond It was great to have you as a supporter
Model: Definitely. If it doesn't go as planned then perhaps you can think about other friends you can talk to.
User: I think you solved my problem, great idea, always there is next
Model: I am glad I had the opportunity to chat with you. I wish you all the best.
User: Thanks, you too! have a good day
Model: You too.

Example conversation #25
User: hi
Model: Hi! Hope you are doing well today. How may I assist you?
User: i am really depressed because of my friends
Model: It seems you are badly hurt by your friend's action. Correct me if I am wrong.
User: yeah
Model: So What's bother you a lot ? What happened which leads you to feel like this?
User: i have heard my friends talk behind my back they are really nice in front of me
Model: That is really bad. It must be hard for you to trust on them.
User: it is i really don't know what to do how can someone you count on do this to you?
Model: How do you come to know that they are talking behind your back? you should talk to them and ask what is the cause that they can't directly talk to you. If something bothers you you should directly talk to that person. Sometime it gives a clear picture.
User: I accidently listened to there conversation i asked them what was wrong by they pretend as if nothing has happened
Model: I can imagine how stressed or shocking it would be for you. It is really hard to count on such friends now.
User: should i leave them?
Model: Once one of my friends lied to me. I wanted to breakup with her. Before that I decided to clear the things that why she did that. Motive behind her lying was not bad. I forgave her and we are still best friends. So you should clarify the things or give them one chance.
User: i was also thinking the same i know they are my true friends
Model: leaving is really easy but having good friends are hard to find. Think about the time when you made wonderful memories.
User: i just don't want them talking when i am not around. if something's wrong with me. just spill it out
Model: Talk to them. They might feel guilty or in future they won't do that. Sometime we indulge in a conversation which starts with fun and later take the drastic turn. It might happen in your case.

Example conversation #26
Model: Hi there, is there anything on your mind at the moment?
User: I'm irritated with family issues atm :(
Model: I am sorry to hear that. So, I gather that you and your loved ones are really not getting along right now?
User: You could say that haha I haven't even seen her in 4 years and she's trying to turn my family against me due to an argument we had that long ago
Model: Okay which family member is that that you are talking about?
User: insecure, narcissistic biological sister who a decade older than me
Model: I see. Family arguments are unfortunately very common so try not to worry too much about it. Do you really need to keep this person in your life though? If you're not speaking, why not just forget about her?
User: Because I live in the same area as my parents and any get togethers we have I don't even want to go to so I don't have to see her and she has used that opportunity to turn anyone she can against me, I cut off contact back then too...
Model: I am really sorry to hear this. I was in a similar situation with a family member a couple of years ago. I know how tiring it can be. Have you talked to any of your other family members about this?
User: I talk to my mom and one brother about it, the other brother I have unfortunately decided to join in with the behind the scenes trash talk (only because he enjoys drama which she's full of) I never spoke much to the rest of my family anyway (they never could understand me even to a degree we could carry a conversation that isn't small talk jabber) so it's not much of a loss except for what she did today has me kind of P.O.d O ur father is where she got it from
Model: What is it that she did today? I can hear the frustration and anger you are experiencing and I hope that I will be able to do something to help you
User: Her daughter (who took more after my personality than hers) came into state and had stated she wanted to stay at her grandparents for the first few days but when she came she ended up going to her moms and when she came to the town we live in she had to bring her mom. Her mom made her to do that for whatever wacky personal issue/emotions she refuses acknowledge and it's a huge bummer because I haven't seen her about 3 years and have small children so I can't really cross country to go visit too easily
Model: I am sorry to hear this. It sounds like she is being rather toxic. Have you considered getting professional help about this? Would she be prepared to address her issues too?
User: That's a huge H E double L lolol I don't love her or value her company enough to consider that, no. IN fact, I kind of want to solve it by beating the living daylights out of her face lol
Model: Well I do not think that that would be a good thing to do. That would be putting you in the wrong.
User: Which actually almost happened when we had that silly argument back when but she called our parents and had them intervene and lie for her uuuuuugh
Model: I think that you need to just totally back away from this relationship before something really bad happens. Can you try to just think that she does not exist and not obsess about her?
User: Yea, she would most definitely call the cops and press charges because she sucks as a human being which is exactly why she's 4 years in my brain still... Haaalp meh, you have any suggestions for making the lil devil in my brain chill?
Model: I hope that I've been able to be of some help to you and thank you for talking. Enjoy the rest of your day!
User: You too, thanks

Example conversation #27
User: Hello?
Model: Hey, hi are you doing today?
User: I'm okay i guess. How are you?
Model: I'm pretty good, I can't complain. Is there any thing going on with your life that you would like to discuss?
User: My marriage recently fell apart and i had to relocate to NC with my children. That's going as well as you would think it is.
Model: I know separation isn't easy, especially with children involved. How are you coping with this transition?
User: I guess im okay, a little shaky and still find myself in tears from time to time. Honestly it is nothing new for me. I've suffered from depressions since i was a young teen
Model: Well breakup is not easy so what you're feeling is normal. Have you ever sought out professional help for depression?
User: Yes I go to the local mental health. I'm actually bipolar 1 which kinda makes my depression a little worse. I see a counselor twice a month. I still however have some trouble in between visits. I just can not afford to be seen more often.
Model: Are there hobbies or activities that you do that help you cope with issues such as jogging, reading, etc.?
User: I read a lot and play rpg games to distract myself. My kids are a big help too. ill admit there are some days despite trying to distract myself i stuggle.
Model: Its good to see that you have activities you participate in that helps you cope. I also play video games to just get away mentally too. But yes, even hobbies are not the cure for issue but rather helps with the symptoms.
User: Oh really what kinda video games to you escape into? I like RPG, romance, adventure, and simulation
Model: I love to play shooters and sports lol. I will be getting into the VR world very soon.
User: Oh i love some shooters. But VR scares me honestly. I heard it can cause seizures
Model: I'm scared as well as it may feel too realistic for me.
User: Yea god forbid playing a shooter in VR O.o
Model: hahaha...Have you tslked to family and friends about the situation? How did they respond and what suggestions did they offer?
User: Well my mama suggested i just forget my ex and not be depressed. My grandpa suggested once i get divorced i should just move on. My brother asked if i wanted him to beat his ass XD lol So not much help honestly
Model: Do you want the relationship to be over or you are truly done and want to move on?
User: I realize i am glad its over. I realize i did not love him like i thought i did. I'm sad that my babies had to suffer for me to realize this.
Model: Although it's tough for the children, it's positive to hear that maybe it was for the best. The family seemed to echo your same feelings so it could be for the best.
User: I certainly hope so. I wonder sometimes. I hope i haven't ruined my kids lives by leaving their father.
Model: Some children may act out if they have trouble expressing how they feel. I would suggest having regular talks with them and being transparent.
User: Yes we had a little trouble with my 8 year old. He thought i and his grandma chased his daddy away. He acted out a lot till we set down with him and explained what happened.
Model: Oh wow, well its good that an explanation was there for him to understand. As time goes on, it will become easier
User: I sure hope so. Thanks so much for your time. You really made me feel better about the situation. I actually enjoyed this hit
Model: No problem, the pleasure was all mines!
User: ^-^ have a good day sugar!
Model: You too, thanks!

Example conversation #28
User: Hi How are you today?
Model: I'm doing fine today. How are you feeling?
User: I'm feeling a little bit anxious today.
Model: Can I ask why that is?
User: I really dropped the ball at work today and I'm so worried that I'm going to get let go.
Model: Would you like to talk more about it? What is making you feel that way?
User: I thought I had everything set up for one of my resident's at a new placement and I called today to confirm and they told me the bed was no longer available. My boss is very intense and I'm scared that when I tell her she will let me go.
Model: I see. It seems as though you've done your best, but I understand your feelings. Is it possible you can speak with your boss about it and explain?
User: I can try that but my boss is very neurotic and I don't think she will want to hear my explanations.
Model: I understand that, I also had a boss who acted this way. I can feel how stressed you are about this. Is there anything you think you can do to jump ahead of the situation?
User: I could call the facility and find out when there next opening is and try to see if I can have the client placed on a waitlist so that he can be moved sooner.
Model: I think that would be a great solution to your problem. I also think you can try some breathing exercises to help you be less anxious.
User: That would actually be helpful. I always forget to do my breathing exercises.
Model: Is there anything else you ussually do to help you relax?
User: I listen to music or watch a funny show on TV.
Model: That seems like a great way to relax! I know that's what helps me as well.
User: Thank you. You have been very helpful. I think I'm going to listen to some music while I do some deep breathing exercises.
Model: I hope that helps, and I hope everything goes great with your boss!
User: Me too! Thanks for the support.
Model: You can always come back for more support if needed!
User: Thanks so much.

Example conversation #29
Model: Hello, how are we doing today?
User: Hi. I'm doing fine. Just feeling a bit anxious.
Model: Would you want to go further into whats causing this anxiety?
User: Well, I am retired, but in need of extra income to meet my financial obligations. It is very difficult for me, however, to wear a mask for longer than a few moments. Due to the mandates in my area, I would be required to wear a mask.
Model: Well, have you tried online platforms like MTurk? It can be bit tough to get into in the beginning, but with a decent amount of work and determination it might be able to help with your monetary problems.
User: That is what I am currently doing, and it is helping some. I have increased the time I work on there, so that will help some. I would love a second source as well, however...just so I could really save some.
Model: I hear you on that. I am disabled and the extra income helps a lot for my family. Unfortunately until the pandemic ends a part time job might not be in your best interest for now. Ebay flipping takes some time to get into as well but could help.
User: Yes, I have thought of that, actually. I have quite a few items I would love to sell. I have never done it, though, so need to research how to ship items, etc.
Model: Its actually very easy now. You can print out the slips at home and they tell you how much it will be. I have done it a few times, the last time was only a couple months a go.
User: Well, I will definitely have to check that out. It would serve two purposes : decluttering and making money. I think I got anxious last week when I had a tire go flat and took my car in to get it fixed. I found out I need all new tires and new brakes. Not easy on a fixed income. Plus I am widowed.
Model: I am sorry for that. Yea having a nest egg is ideal, but i know how hard it can be. I think with the extra cash and space it may be a big help to those anxiety issues. Do you drive a lot as it is now?
User: I actually don't. Only to the grocery store, or to visit my daughter who lives about 20 minutes away.
Model: Well at least you are not putting to much wear on them now. Have you checked with local governments for assistance? Even with things like medication?
User: I am not on any medication, which I am so thankful of. I have not checked any programs for assistance. I'm not sure if I would even qualify. It wouldn't hurt to try, I guess.
Model: Believe me never hurts to try. A penny you save on something else can be a penny that goes into your savings
User: That is so true! I have been selling some items through my neighborhood online Marketplace and made $100 just this week. I have also started a change jar. Amazing how a bit here and there can add up.
Model: Wow thats pretty good. Yeah it is. It seems you are very proactive about this which is really good.
User: Yes. I am definitely one not to give up, which is a good thing! I appreciate your help. I feel more positive now.
Model: I am very glad i could be of some help. I truly believe you have this handled.
User: Thank you very much. I hope you have a blessed day.
Model: You as well!

Example conversation #30
User: Hello, how are you doing today?
Model: Im okay how are you?
User: I am glad you are doing okay, I am struggling with my current employer which has brought me an area of anger and sadness.
Model: Oh no, that's not good. I understand how you feel there. I can definately relate to that...What's going on?
User: My employer is great, I work for a local hospital as a house keeper technician, but my department is poorly observed by HR and corporate. I have been excelling in my role and went from part time employee with no benefits at 40hrs a week, but since I have a applied for our security team I was denied because I took the full time position and have to wait another 4 months. I have already worked in this position for 7 months.
Model: So you applied for the Security Team and was denied because of your full time position with the same company?
User: Correct, when I took the position my manager said that I could transfer after six months. I felt lied to and the micromanaging and high turn overstaff due to my supervisor has me on that same boat now. I feel like my only option is to quit. HR was the one who delivered the transfer denial.
Model: Wow, that is crazy that is going on, it doesn't seem fair at all... Have you tried going to any higher up? Perhaps in the HR department?
User: I am thoroughly disappointed, I have applied for a few local security job sites in my area that have had some interest in my resume. I figure I will leave the hospital since I was lied and I can only see this being the trend with this department. They keep their good workers and let the low skilled workers transfer out or they just quit.
Model: That's horrible they would treat the HOSPITAL workers like this, with everything that is going on in the world today.
User: I have a six page paper of grievances for HR and a full unscripted transparent experience as an employer with details and dates of these frustrations. I know it will not go anywhere since their policy states that an employee must work six months from when they take a new position within the company. I went from a housekeep to a housekeeper technician (scrub walls and take curtains down and clean contact rooms).
Model: That is a position right there in the line of fire. Have you tried for employment anywhere else? I wouldn't just quit and not have something else at least working in the background.
User: I am paid $10.75 an hour and their security team makes about $12.50 plus overtime opportunities and details. I went to school for criminal justice and the hospital would have helped me obtain my bachelors if I worked for them after completing it, I had to work there for a year in order to get their help. I was looking forward to this opportunity, but now I am just to bitter to work there at this point. I loved what we stand for value wise, but their values are not walked out I have an interview soon with another company that I am just waiting on the details for, I think this will yield more fruit once I get the approval. I am uncertain if I will give two weeks if I can do a "start today" option.
Model: I definitely understand that. Do you want a couple links on dealing with some stress? I personally like to run..
User: Sure links are always helpful (for the record, I left the employer and work for fabulous healthcare company now that I have been with for two years). Do you run during the winter when it is cold, or do you have different coping strategies for the winter time. It is 8 degrees where I am at.
Model: I live in Georgia so yes i so run every morning...Great stress reliever Wow that is cold.. I could not run in that what so ever... Do you have a gym?

Example conversation #31
Model: Hi, are you having a good day at the moment?
User: Today is okay, i guess. I'm just stressed.
Model: Is there a general problem that you would like to talk about? I am more than happy to listen.
User: Yes, I found out I didnt pass college algebra and my academic advisor is pressuring me to take the class over this winter break in order to graduate on time. But I have been in new york city all year and my parents just got me tickets to fly home I really miss them
Model: I am sorry to hear that but try not to panic, just failing one class is not the end of the world. How do you feel about retaking it?
User: I don't mind retaking it, really
Model: Ah so you feel that this is going to be severely disruptive to your plans for this winter break?
User: yha. also, im worried i might fail again if i get too distracted by my family
Model: Is it possible for you to get any sort of private tutoring which might help you?
User: i mean, tutoring is just another added time commitment. I really failed the first time because i was depressed and unmotivated. which is why I'm excited to be with my family finally
Model: Ah .. in that case is it possible to talk to your doctor? They might be able to get a special allowance for you given your personal circumstances
User: yeah. that's another thing. I havent told my therapist or even my parents yet that i failed
Model: I think that it would be a really good idea if you talked to them about it. They will probably be a lot more understanding than you might think
User: what if they're disappointed
Model: If they love you, and I am sure that your family do, then they will accept what has happened without criticism
User: how do i even begin to start the conversation
Model: Well, do you have any siblings that you are close to and that you could tell first?
User: yeah i told my twin sister, actually
Model: It is good to hear you have a twin. Are you very close?
User: definitely. we go to different schools but we live together in nyc
Model: Well I think that it might be a very good idea if she could approach the rest of your family and maybe even your therapist on your behalf?
User: yha she's better at breaking bad news than i do... maybe i can ask her. i think i should tell my therapist myself though.
Model: Well, your therapist is not, in my mind, as important as your family. But I think that both will understand!
User: yeah. well i feel much better about this. thank you so much

Example conversation #32
Model: Hello there, how are you doing?
User: I'm okay I guess
Model: You seem a little down. Is there anything you'd like to talk about?
User: I just don't feel like I'm good enough lately
Model: So you are experiencing feelings of inadequacy? That is very sad. Can you tell me why you think you feel this way? Has anything changed lately?
User: Yes I feel very inadequate. Recently my best friend and I can't get along. She's always upset at me about things I'm doing
Model: I am sorry to hear that. I've experienced difficulties with friendships too. Do you think you can talk with her?
User: I've tried taking to her, usually she gets very angry with me and starts yelling. She never listens to what I have to say.
Model: It sounds a little as though her behaviour is toxic. Does the friendship really mean that much to you?
User: She means so much to me and she's my only friend.
Model: So you feel that the friendship is worth fighting for, but she is not being responsive?
User: More than that, she's not being supportive of my decisions and that's all I want
Model: Was there one specific thing that triggered this or had it been coming for a long time?
User: She hates my boyfriend, she wants me to leave him. If i don't she doesn't want to hang around me as much. She said I have to choose him or her.
Model: Would you consider having some counselling together? Perhaps talk through what is going on? She has no right to issue you with an ultimatum like that.
User: She moved all of her things out of our dorm room we share just because I'm still with my boyfriend. I woukd do counselling but I'm not sure she would
Model: I really feel as though you are the one putting all the effort in here and she is just making selfish demands on you. Perhaps it is time to try and make some new friends? Join a society or something?
User: I've realized I want to spend the rest of my life with my boyfriend and I don't think she'll like that.
Model: I think you know deep down what is the best thing to do. You don't need selfish people in your life.
User: I'm a little reluctant, I'm very shy and struggle with making new friends, that's why she is do important to me.
Model: You have your boyfriend though :). He will always be there for you - and not treat you as badly as she has!
User: Yes that's true. What do I say to her?
Model: I don't think you owe her an explanation after how she has behaved. Leave her to make the next move I hope I have been able to help you a little!
User: The problem is we technically share a room. She does come in occasionally.
Model: I know that you must feel that this could be a problem but I think you will be able to just ignore her. I am afraid I must leave for my next appointment now.
User: Okay! Thank you for the advice.
Model: you're most welcome and enjoy the rest of your day! (I think you have to quit your end ;))

Example conversation #33
User: I am worried that my Director played a game she was not able to play, got caught, and was forced to resign. I am not sure what that means for me. Any help would be appreciated.
Model: Can you explain to me what exactly kind of game it was?
User: It was a political game where she isolated the president and made him no longer support her. It was quite a misstep on her part.
Model: ok so your director played a game she was not allowed to play and she got caught playing it and quit her job is that correct?
User: Yes. She got put on a performance improvement plan and responded poorly. She was forcced to resign.
Model: So you are scared that you might get in trouble?
User: Not in trouble but vulnerable because she hired me. Will her boss see me as part of the problem?
Model: I am so sorry you are going through this and i know how you are feeling
User: Thanks. It's been weird. I just met with two of the board today to go over where the organization is.
Model: you should not have anything to worry about as long as you did not play the game then you will be fine and you will not get in trouble or your boss will not see that as a problem.
User: Thanks. I tried to just support her privately and seem neutral publicly. I did like her too. I thought she was good.
Model: I would just suggest you to have no contact with her right now until all this passes
User: I text her to see how she was doing but haven't text with her since Friday. Any other ideas?
Model: I would also have a talk with your boss about the situation and let him know how you are feeling
User: I also want her job. Does that seem weird to talk with him about that too?
Model: Did you see your director playing the game? I would not bring up about you wanting her job just yet give it a couple of days
User: No, her boss did not play the game. He actually pulled out and let others handle it so he didn't seem biased. She overplayed her hand.
Model: I can see this is a tough being in a situation like this
User: Yeah. I have never been this high in an organization so I just don't know what to do. I am hoping someone outside the organization might have a better view of what I should do.
Model: As long as you did nothing wrong then i am sure you will be just fine
User: Thanks. Your help is appreciated.
Model: do not let the situation get the best of you everything will be just fine
User: Thanks.
Model: your welcome Have a great day and stay safe

Example conversation #34
User: hi
Model: Hello
User: how are you?
Model: I am good, how are you?
User: I am feeling okay, a little upset.
Model: What is making you upset tonight?
User: i was mad, but now i am just upset. My professor put in grades for my class earlier this week. My grade dropped 5 points and i do not have an A anymore.
Model: Just to make sure I understand, you got a bad grade in one of your classes and your grade dropped below an A and you are upset about it.
User: yes that is right
Model: Have you talked to your professor about the reason for the grade you got that dropped your grade below an A? Often it helps to understand what we did wrong in order to know what we can do to improve.
User: Yes I have, she said she explain the rules out in the syllabus and would not change it. SHe gave our whole class a 0 on the final.
Model: Have you reached out to your advisor to speak with them on the situation? Often times your advisor is able to help with advice on what to do in this type of situation.
User: No, i have talked to my advisor once and she is not that helpful as she is a professor herself. She told me its okay if I dont have an A, I am still passing. I just worked hard all semester, just to end with a 89.9.
Model: I had a similar situation last semester where I held an A in my class all semester long until the end when it dropped to a B+ so I comletely understand the frustration here.
User: Yea i understand that is happens to a lot of people, and we just have to move on and learn. That is hwy im not mad anymore just upset.
Model: I know it is extremely difficult to do that when you really want to keep your grades up, but I know you can get through this!
User: I am going to try my best next semester so that this does not happen again.
Model: You will do a great job! '
User: I really hope so, thank you
Model: You are very welcome! If you ever need anything else, feel free to chat again!
User: I feel okay now, thank you!
Model: You're very welcome! I am glad I was able to help!

Example conversation #35
User: Hi!
Model: Hello, how are you doing today?
User: Not so good. I have conspiracy theorist as a friend who is now mad at me because I told her to pull up her mask while talking to me. We have been friends for 13 years I am hurt and confused that she still thinks this is a game. She thought Corona was fake until someone we know caught it. It is like she is mad she was wrong and is taking it out and lashing out at those who have been trying to persuade her the whole time... what do you think?
Model: It sounds like you care a lot about your friend and others. How old is your friend? It sounds like you care a lot about your friend and others. How old is your friend?
User: She is 44! Too old for all this nonsense. She has a short temper.......I think I am going to have to separate myself from her for the duration of the virus and the cure. I cannot talk to her again unless she agrees to get vaccinated. She is all to careless.
Model: I see, it does sound like she is being negligent with her behavior and not respecting of you and your concern on this virus. When you say your friend does not believe in the virus, what is her stance on it?
User: She thought it was faked for political reasons at first. Then when she found out it was real when it struck close to home, she is saying it is apart of population control. Honestly she is all over the place. I find her very dangerous to others right now. I don't think our friendship will survive this because I am willing to part ways for all of our safety. I hate that but will do it. \
Model: I can relate with your friend, at the beginning I had similar thoughts. As my friends started working on those units and my members being hospitalized for it, I surrendered my political stance and dawned my mask. I have a friend who is just like your friend, they have politicized it and had first degree exposure and blew up when we had her sit out of our teen support group/youth group and church services for two weeks. She is in her 50's. I can relate with your friend, at the beginning I had similar thoughts.

User: Wow...that is deep and I believe you are right when you say these situations cause us to take care of ourselves first. I think that it just what I am going to do. After all this is over I will attempt to mend our relationship but for now I have to protect those I love. Thanks for the great advice. You were very helpful. I hope you have a great Christmas and new year. Stay safe!
Model: It is my pleasure, I appreciate you being vulnerable and sharing where you are at in this moment. It is not always easy, continue to find people who are willing to listen and be the change that we need. Have a wonderful Christmas and a safe New Year!
User: Hello oops
Model: Hello, I am still here. Is there anything else that I can help you with today?

Example conversation #36
Model: Hello, how are you feeling today?
User: feeling disgust as usual. yourself?
Model: I have been feeling a little low too. Would you like to tell me a bit about why you are disgusted with yourself?
User: well, i'm not disgusted with myself... it's just people in general. everybody.. they're so selfish any they all care about superifical things
Model: Ah yes, this has been especially obvious during the pandemic hasn't it? Too many people not following the social distancing rules
User: well, you could say that. take christmas, for example. people give everyone else gifts out of obligation
Model: Do you feel that the pandemic has made you feel worse? Or have you felt like this for a long time?
User: a long time. more as i age. i'm actually tired about hearing about the pandemic, really. it is all people ever talk about. more people are probably dying of obesity eating themselves to death
Model: Well, it is a pretty significant issue this year :). Re obesity, have you considered doing something to raise awareness?
User: I think it would be beating a dead horse. Ober half the population is overweight. People would just need to be blind not to see it. That's kind of my point. Everything is consume... consume.. consume.... buy buy buy
Model: So you feel as though there is no bright side - that everything is just artificial and superficial?
User: well... you can't really do anything without money. it all kind of rides on it, doesn't it? what you can buy?
Model: I don't mean to sound twee but there are things out there in life that can be appreciated for free :)
User: Yea, a few things here and there. Nature, let's say. But nature doesn't really give one way or another about you. My friends have a lot of money, though, and none of them are even happy. thats even more saddening
Model: I know what you mean about that. I know plenty of people who spend too much of their life working every hour and it leaves them no time to appreciate their money!
User: Yea, I know, right. I have one friends who has probably about 100k in the bank, and he will complain if he spent 4 cents too much on gas over another gas station.
Model: People like that are irritating, certainly. I am not sure what the solution is, other than to ignore them.
User: yea, it's hard, though, because sooner or later it comes out in almost everyone i meet. who knows. maybe even i do it and don't even know it. thats scary, you know at least your honest
Model: Well, the fact that you can reflect on it indicates to me that you are probably not guilty. Most of those who do this are totally unaware. It has been really nice chatting to you and I hope that things go your way in 2021. You seem like good person :)
User: Thanks. Probably true. sometimes when i bring it up they'll just argue about it and defend themselves. i just try to move on but it is always there. ok. yea it is 15 minutes so bye bye good talking
Model: you too :) you need to finish from your end .. I can't :)

Example conversation #37
User: hi . god morning
Model: Hello , How are you today

Example conversation #38
Model: Hello!
User: Hi thanks for chatting with me today. I've been really down and could use someone to talk to.
Model: Of course! What have been down about?
User: I always get sad around the holidays but this year has been so much worse because I'm spending the holidays alone.
Model: Oh I'm sorry to hear that. I know being alone in the holidays can be rough.
User: All I have to do is think about how alone I am.
Model: Do you have any friends or people you can set up an online zoom call with?
User: I tried that but no one that I know is tech savvy that can make Zoom work.
Model: Also I feel that as well. Especially now these days its a bit hard to not think about being alone.
User: I just keep thinking about all the bad things happening in the world right now. If I had someone to spend time with I'm sure it would take my mind off of it but people aren't allowed to get together.
Model: Oh how about just texting or having periodic phone calls with friends? Yeah the pandemic has really stopped interactions. But that doesn't mean you can't stop talking to people completely!
User: I try that but everyone is busy with their families today. I don't have a family so I'm all alone.
Model: Oh I see I'm so sorry to hear that. Have you tried doing other activities to make your mind off it?
User: I tried watching a movie but my mind starts to wander.
Model: For me personally doing online gaming is a great way to interact with others and have fun.
User: Maybe I'll try that. Any game suggestions?
Model: What type of movie were you trying to watch? Maybe choose a happier movie than a sad one.
User: I was watching a comedy. It's a movie I usually like but I just couldn't keep my mind from wandering.
Model: I would recommend games like Heartstone for stragedy, WoW for more role playing and if your into sci-fi, Cyberpunk cam out recently. Really any game that has multiplayer would be a good fit!
User: I like strategy games. They really make you think which helps distract you from what you don't want to think about!
Model: Oh sweet me too actually! I definitely recommend heartstone or any game that has a battle mode form
User: Thanks! I'm going to look into playing the game! That might be just what I need to bring me out of this funk!
Model: Also I know thats its currently the holidays so maybe take your mind off right now and ask your friends later if they can talk!
User: Yes, I'm sure they'll have more free time after tomorrow!
Model: I'm glad I can help! Is there anything else you would like to talk about>
User: No, I'm ready to look into the game! No, thank you! I'm ready to get going and look into playing the game you suggested!
Model: Okay well I hope you have a great day!

Example conversation #39
User: Hello
Model: Hi, how are you feeling today?
User: I'm feeling a bit confused and anxious.
Model: okay, that is valid, do you have an idea what is causing the confusion?
User: So I've been dating and my parents are aware. But recently after I said I want to go on a trip with my boyfriend, my parents have all sorts of opinions about it. And all their traditional beliefs that I did not know existed are now on the surface and they are kinda forcing me to follow it. For say they think "bad types of woman" go on trips with their boyfriends and I need to save myself. They have been guilt tripping me and I feel very confused.
Model: Your feelings are valid and it is okay to feel confused in this situation considering you love your boyfriend and parents Have you tried discussing with your boyfriend to talk to your parents as a means of reassuring them? Or getting someone neutral that your parents trust to talk to them?
User: I have. It's been a long stressful month of discussion. The problem is I don't share their beliefs, and I haven't been really "saving myself". I'm been living away from them for collage quite a while and I've been basically doing stuff that if they found out they would be very upset about. But I didn't think it bothers them because they never shared any of this. And they said if I go on this trip I'm disrespecting them and the entire family. But his parents are totally cool and don't seem to mind.
Model: I get how difficult and upsetting this situation is to you, i have been in a similar situation, however, in my case i took charge of my life, though they are my parents i did what i felt is good for me Before i continue, do you mind me asking how old you are?
User: I'm 26 And I see what you're saying. It's really hard breaking free because they always monitored me my entire life. I never had a voice for myself. They basically bullied and forced me to do what they wanted. BTW if you didn't guess I'm their favorite child.
Model: Okay, you are old enough to be away from your parents, i am going to suggest you sitting with them down and having a heart to heart discussion with them Let them know the consequences of them forcing you, your feelings towards it and how unhappy you are with them restricting you
User: Should I tell them everything I did that goes against what they believe? So they know that I don't share their beliefs ?
Model: No, i think that should be personal to you, i would not suggest you hurting or making them see you as a disappointment I am sure you will be fine after discussing with them, they will come around
User: I guess worst case I won't talk to them for a while : ) Thank you , that helped.
Model: They might be sad and upset now but they will get over it definitely You are welcome
User: Have a good one!
Model: You too

Model: Hi there, what is life like for you right now?
User: Pretty stressful. I'm a little bit anxious about school.
Model: So you're worried about your studies? I will try to help if I can. Please tell me all you can.
User: Thank you. I am finishing up my third year in college so I have some career decisions to make. I'm also trying to find a job for this summer related to what I want to study.
Model: Are you finding that things are being made difficult because of the pandemic?
User: Yes. Most of my classes are online. I really miss my friends and family.

User: I do live with three of my friends so it's nice to have their support. I'm glad I'm not alone
Model: What sort of thing do you want to go into when your studies are over?
User: I'm studying psychology, I want to become a therapist or social worker
Model: That is a really worth profession. Have you thought of doing some volunteer work before you graduate?
User: Yes! I am trying to get a job at a suicide hotline for the summer
Model: That is an awesome thing to do though it could be very mentally draining. Do you feel up to it?
User: I know I'm up to it, but this week I've been having a hard time Just struggling to stay motivated in school
Model: Don't put yourself under too much pressure if you are suffering yourself.
User: I try not to. Sometimes it's hard to put myself first
Model: I think a lot of people who work helping other people have that sort of problem - it's too easy to neglect yourself.
User: It's good to hear I'm not alone in feeling this way
Model: Is there anything else you'd like to tell me about how you're feeling right now?
User: I got a job offer today, I'm very proud of myself!
Model: That sounds wonderful - is it the sort of job you were really looking for?
User: Sort of. It's an opportunity to work for one of my favorite professors over the summer. I'm still going to work on that suicide hotline job as well
Model: Don't over extend yourself though. Make sure to give yourself plenty of you time.
User: That's a good point. I struggle with that.
Model: Maybe set aside a few hours each week where you do something just for you, even if someone else claims that they need you.
User: I will try that! Okay, thank you so much for your advice. I'm going to log off now. This has been very helpful.
Model: Wait till we hit the fifteen minute mark :D. And you're most welcome, have a lovely day!
