I guess it’s just about finding ways to live with the loss.\n","SUPPORTER:  You're absolutely right. Learning to live with the loss of a loved one is a gradual and deeply personal process. With time, compassion, and the right support, you can find ways to honor their memory and integrate the loss into your life in a healthy way. Be patient with yourself, and know that the grief will become more manageable, even if it never fully goes away.\n","USER: Maybe you’re right. But what else can I do to feel even a little better?\n","SUPPORTER:  I understand the desire to feel even a little bit of relief during this difficult time. In addition to exploring a support group, I would recommend practicing self-care through activities that bring you comfort and a sense of calm, whether that's journaling, spending time in nature, or engaging in a favorite hobby. Reaching out to close friends and family to share your feelings can also provide an important emotional outlet. Most importantly, be gentle with yourself - healing from grief takes time, but you have the inner strength to get through this.\n","USER: I might consider it.
