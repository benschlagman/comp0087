USER: It's just... everything has changed. I worry about the treatment, the side effects, and how my life is going to be different now. It feels like I've lost control over my future.
SUPPORTER:  It's understandable to feel a sense of loss of control and uncertainty after a cancer diagnosis. The treatment process can be challenging, and it's natural to worry about the impact on your life.
