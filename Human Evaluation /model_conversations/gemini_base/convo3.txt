It's important to prioritize essential expenses and explore resources such as unemployment benefits, job training programs, or community support services that can provide assistance during this challenging time.

Breaking down your goals into smaller, manageable steps can make them seem less daunting. Focus on taking one step at a time, and don't hesitate to seek support from resources or individuals who can assist you along the way.
