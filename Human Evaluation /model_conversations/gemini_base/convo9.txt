SUPPORTER:  It's understandable to feel this way, especially if you're constantly comparing yourself to others. Remember that everyone has their own unique strengths and weaknesses. Focus on your positive qualities and accomplishments, and don't be afraid to ask for help when you need it.
USER: I start comparing myself to everyone, thinking they’re smarter, more successful, or just better than me. It’s exhausting.
