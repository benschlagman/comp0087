SUPPORTER:  The fear of falling behind and not meeting expectations can be paralyzing.
USER: It can. What can I do to handle this better?
SUPPORTER:  Consider breaking down large tasks into smaller, more manageable chunks.
USER: How do I do that?
SUPPORTER:  Try dividing assignments into smaller sections and setting realistic deadlines for each section.
USER: Ok, so I should plan more? Is there anything else I can do?
SUPPORTER:  Prioritizing tasks based on importance and urgency can help you focus on the most critical ones first.
USER: Ok, anything else?
