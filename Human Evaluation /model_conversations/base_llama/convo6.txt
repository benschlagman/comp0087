SUPPORTER: It's common for intrusive memories and flashbacks to occur when someone has experienced a traumatic event, like the one you witnessed. Avoiding thinking about it or trying to stay busy may not necessarily help in managing these symptoms, especially if you're pushing the thoughts away instead of confronting them head-on. Here are some additional strategies that might be helpful:

As you do this, notice any areas of tension or discomfort and take a slow, deep breath into those areas. Hold for a few seconds before exhaling. This can help you become more aware of your physical sensations and release any pent-up energy.
