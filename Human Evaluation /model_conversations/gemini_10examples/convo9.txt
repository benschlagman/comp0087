USER: I’ve been really struggling with my self-esteem lately. I just feel like I’m not good enough, no matter what I do.
SUPPORTER:  I can understand that. It can be really tough to feel like you're not good enough. What kinds of things are you doing to try to boost your self-esteem?
USER: I guess I don't do much to boost my self esteem. I tend to compare myself to others a lot. I feel like almost everyone is smarter, better looking or more succesful than me. I feel so behind.
SUPPORTER:  Comparing yourself to others is a surefire way to feel bad about yourself. Everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses. Instead of focusing on what you don't have, try to focus on what you do have. What are some of your good qualities?
USER: I don't really know, I like painting very much even though I'm not the best at it. When I paint I can get out of my own head
SUPPORTER:  That's great! Painting is a wonderful hobby. It's a great way to relax and express yourself. And who knows, with practice, you may find that you're better at it than you think.
USER: It is very relaxing. But I haven't had much time to paint much these days, I've been so busy
SUPPORTER:  It's important to make time for the things that make you happy. Even if it's just for a little while each day, try to set aside some time to paint. It will help you to relax and de-stress.
USER: Ok, I will try to give myself some free time to paint. Do you think this will make me feel any better?
SUPPORTER:  It's possible that painting will help you to feel better. When you paint, you are able to express yourself creatively and let go of any stress or worries that you may be holding onto.
USER: Ok, that is true
SUPPORTER:  I'm glad that you're willing to give painting a try. I think it could be a really helpful way for you to relax and de-stress.
USER: bye
SUPPORTER:  Goodbye. I hope you have a great day!
