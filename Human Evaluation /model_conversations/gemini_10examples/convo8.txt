SUPPORTER:  Recognize your fears, but don't let them paralyze you. Focus on the present task and break it down into smaller steps. Seek support from teachers, classmates, or a tutor if needed. Remember, setbacks are part of the learning process.
USER: I've thought about joining a study group but haven't taken the step yet. I guess I'm worried it won't help, or I'll just end up feeling more behind.
SUPPORTER:  Understandable concerns. Study groups can be beneficial for clarifying concepts, sharing perspectives, and holding each other accountable. Consider giving it a try with an open mind. If it doesn't meet your expectations, you can always adjust your approach or seek alternative support.
