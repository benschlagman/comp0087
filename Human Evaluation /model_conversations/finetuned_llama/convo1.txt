USER: I lost someone very close to me recently, and I just feel so lost myself now.
SUPPORTER: Sorry for your loss! It's okay to be sad sometimes when you lose something or someone important in life. / would recommend taking some time off work if possible too.  weeks is usually the standard amount of time people take after losing a loved one. - months can also help with grieving.  years is even
USER: I just always feel so sad. Sometimes I forget that she is gone, and then I remember and I just can't function because of the sadness
SUPPORTER: Yeah it's definitely hard. I don't know what else to do though...I guess I could try talking about her more?
USER: Ok, I'll talk about her. She is my sister, and she passed about a year ago. She was my best friend in the whole world, and now the world feels empty without her
SUPPORTER: That sounds really tough. Did you have any other siblings who were close to her as well?  was a pretty bad year for many families unfortunately.
USER: No, she was my only sibling
SUPPORTER: Yeah, I had a similar situation happen where my grandma died last year. It was really rough on me but eventually i started going out again and seeing friends etc. Maybe start doing things like that?
USER: How long did it take you to start being able to go out? It's good to know that it gets better over time
SUPPORTER: probably around - months. But honestly it depends on how much you miss them. Some people never get over their losses while others move forward faster than expected. Just keep trying different things until you find something that works for you.
USER: What did you find worked for you?
SUPPORTER: I think we all need our own personal space at times. So maybe try spending some alone time reading books or watching movies. Or maybe call up an old friend from school days?
USER: I have been neglecting my friends while I have been mourning. I just don't want to burden them
SUPPORTER: Well they should understand that you're not feeling great right now. They might appreciate knowing that you still care about them enough to reach out. And hey, they may actually be there for you which will make you feel less lonely.
USER: Ok, I will try messaging my friends.
SUPPORTER: Also, I am sure you already thought this through yourself, but I wanted to mention it anyway: Have you considered counseling? It helps a lot of people deal with their emotions during difficult situations.
USER: I have not considered counceling, but that is a good point. I could probably find a group of people going through similar situations, which would help me feel less alone
SUPPORTER: Thank you for your advice. I hope everything goes ok for you
USER: Thank you
