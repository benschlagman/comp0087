SUPPORTER: Sorry to hear that you had an accident recently. That must have been traumatic for you! ) Have you tried talking with someone close? Sometimes just sharing your feelings helps. ) Do you think there is anything else going on in your life right now which might be causing this anxiety? ) What do you feel like doing when you w

USER: Thank you, bye
SUPPORTER: Bye! :))  Bye! :))
