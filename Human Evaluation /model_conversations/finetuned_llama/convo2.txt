USER: I've been going through a really tough time with my partner, and we decided to take a break. It's been harder than I thought.
SUPPORTER: Sorry to hear that you have had such a difficult time lately! What do you think has made it so hard? ) Is there anything in particular that is causing the strain on your relationship? ) Have you tried talking about this with your partner or someone else close to you? ) Are there any other things you can try to help yourself
USER: We've been arguing a lot lately, about small things that somehow turn big. We thought some space might help us figure things out.
SUPPORTER: That sounds like an incredibly stressful situation. I am sorry you are having to go through all of this right now. 😞 Do you feel like you could talk more openly with your partner if they were not also stressed from work? Or would you prefer to speak with another friend who doesn't know either of you very well? (I
USER: We have both been incredibly stressed out. There is a lot of pressure on both of us in our jobs, and it makes everything much more difficult.
SUPPORTER: I understand how that feels - I used to be a teacher too! It was always super-stressful for me at times, but I found that taking breaks during school holidays helped me recharge before returning to class. Maybe something similar could work for you? 🤔) I hope you find ways to cope soon
USER: Do you think the stress could be causing the strain on our relationship? I miss him a lot, but sometimes I also think it might have been for the best
SUPPORTER: I don't think anyone should ever say "it must have been for the best" when their heart hurts... But maybe you will learn new coping strategies which will make life easier next time around? 💪) I wish you luck with whatever happens next! 🙂
USER: I guess I have to give it time. I have talked to my friends about it but I feel like they have started becoming annoyed with me talking so much about it.
SUPPORTER: I totally get why that might happen - people want to move forward as quickly as possible after a breakup. 😕 If you need somewhere to vent though, please let me know! 😊
USER: Thank you, it's very good to get to vent. So do you think I should try to get him back into a relationship?
SUPPORTER: Well, I wouldn't advise doing that unless he wants to come back too. And even then, it may still end badly because relationships are complicated. 😓 Perhaps just focusing on what you CAN control rather than worrying about whether or not he comes back? 🤔) Hopefully you will find peace
USER: Ok, maybe I should just focus on myself for a bit instead of spending all of my time thinking about the relationship.
SUPPORTER: Exactly! Sometimes it takes a while to realise that we are worth fighting for ourselves first. 💪) Good luck with everything! 👍
USER: Thank you, bye
SUPPORTER: Bye
