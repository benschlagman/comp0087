USER: I’ve been really struggling with my self-esteem lately. I just feel like I’m not good enough, no matter what I do.
SUPPORTER: That sounds very difficult to deal with. It can be hard when you don't think that anything is going right in your life and it seems as though nothing will ever change for the better. Do you have any friends or family members who could help you through this?
USER: My friends and family are nice but I'm scared that if I tell them they will think I am pathetic
SUPPORTER: YesI guess so.
USER: So what do you think I should do? My self esteem is starting to affect my social life as I don't see why anybody would want to be friends with me :(
SUPPORTER: Well maybe instead of telling people how bad things are, try talking about all the positive aspects of yourself. Maybe even write down some things that make you happy and read them every day until you start feeling more confident.
USER: Ok, I guess I am pretty good at making art. It's also what allows me to get out of my head the most
SUPPORTER: Oh wow! Art must be something that makes you extremely proud then. Have you considered selling your work online?
USER: I have thought about posting it online, but that sounds kinda scary. Maybe I could post it anonymously?
SUPPORTER: Yeah that might actually be best because if you put your name on it then there may be negative feedback from other artists. But if you sell it under another name then nobody knows who made it unless they go looking for it.
USER: Yeah, it might be easier to take critisism if I'm anonymous 
SUPPORTER: Thanks for listening :D
