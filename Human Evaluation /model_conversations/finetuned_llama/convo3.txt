USER: I've been really struggling financially lately, and it feels like things are just getting worse. I don't know what to do.
SUPPORTER: That sounds very difficult for you right now. Have you tried talking with your friends or family? They may be able to help out in some way. / would recommend. ) Do you have any hobbies that might take your mind off of the financial struggles? Maybe try knitting or something. ) Is there anything else
USER: I have talked to my friends and family, and while they are sad I'm having troubles, I don't think they can help me much except by listening.
SUPPORTER: Well if you feel comfortable doing so, maybe you could ask them about their own experiences when they were struggling financially. It might make you feel better knowing that someone else has gone through this too! :) / would definitely suggest trying that first before looking into other options. ) I understand how hard it is to talk about money problems though...I'
USER: That would be helpful, I guess. I just never thought I'd be in this position, you know?
SUPPORTER: Yeah, I totally get where you are coming from. Sometimes we all need a little reminder that we aren't alone in our struggles. And hey, at least you're not alone here on this chat! :D) I hope everything works out well for you soon. If you ever want to vent more, please feel free
USER: I'm just so stressed! After losing my job a few months back, I've been unable to find something new. My savings are running low, and I'm worried about making rent next month.
SUPPORTER: Oh no, sorry to hear that! Are you planning on moving somewhere cheaper? Or did you lose your job because of COVID-? (Just curious.) / would also suggest reaching out to local organizations who specialize in helping people get back on their feet after being laid off due to COVID. There should be plenty of resources available online
USER: It wasn't because of covid, but due to the state of the economy. It's a good point to reach out to some organizations, but I don't know which ones I can try. Do you know of any?
SUPPORTER: Yeah, unfortunately there isn't as many resources for those affected by the pandemic. But hopefully you will be able to find one near you. In the meantime, I would suggest taking up a part time job until you are able to find another full time gig. At least then you won't have to worry about paying bills
USER: That's true, I could work a part time job until I can find a full time job as well. 
SUPPORTER: Thank you for your suggestions!
USER: They were all yours! Thank you for your help
SUPPORTER: No problem! Good luck with everything! Bye!
