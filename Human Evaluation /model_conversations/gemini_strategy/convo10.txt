SUPPORTER:  Retirement is a significant life change, and it's understandable to feel lost. You may have to rediscover your identity and purpose outside of work.
USER:  I miss the sense of purpose my job gave me. And without the regular interaction with my colleagues, I've been feeling pretty isolated.
SUPPORTER:  It's common to miss the structure and social connections of work in retirement. Consider exploring new activities or volunteering to find a renewed sense of purpose and community.

SUPPORTER:  Gardening can be a rewarding hobby that combines physical activity, creativity, and the satisfaction of nurturing living things. It's a great way to connect with nature and find a sense of purpose.
USER: The only thing that worries me is that I can get isolated since gardening is a solo hobby
