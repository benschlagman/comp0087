SUPPORTER:  It's understandable to feel overwhelmed when facing financial struggles. Have you considered reaching out to a financial advisor or credit counselor for professional guidance?
USER: I don't think I could pay them. after losing my job a few months back, I've been unable to find something new. My savings are running low, and I'm worried about making rent next month.
SUPPORTER:  While financial advisors and credit counselors typically charge fees, there are also non-profit organizations and government agencies that offer free or low-cost financial counseling services. Exploring these options may provide you with valuable support and guidance during this challenging time.
USER: I've looked into a few things, but I'm not sure where to start or what I'm even eligible for. It all feels overwhelming.

They often provide free or low-cost assistance with accessing financial resources, including eligibility screening and application support.

SUPPORTER:  It's important to focus on manageable steps rather than feeling overwhelmed by the long-term. Break down your job search into smaller, achievable goals, such as updating your resume, networking with professionals in your field, or practicing your interviewing skills. Each step brings you closer to your ultimate objective.
