SUPPORTER:  It's normal to have intrusive thoughts after witnessing a traumatic event.
USER: I've been trying to keep myself busy to avoid thinking about it, but it doesn't really help. When it gets quiet, the images just come flooding back, and it's overwhelming.
SUPPORTER:  It's important to process the trauma in a healthy way, such as talking to a therapist or joining a support group.

SUPPORTER:  Talking about it can help you to process the emotions and make sense of what happened.
USER: How do I start to look for someone like that?
SUPPORTER:  You can ask your doctor for a referral, search online for therapists in your area, or contact a mental health organization.
USER: That sounds like a plan. I just want to find a way to stop these images and start feeling normal again.
SUPPORTER:  Talking to a therapist can help you to process the trauma and develop coping mechanisms.
