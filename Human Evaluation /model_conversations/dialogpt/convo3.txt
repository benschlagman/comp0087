USER: Lately, I've been feeling really isolated. I moved to a new city a few months ago for work, and it's been hard to make any real connections here.
SUPPORTER: I know how that can feel, but I am not sure that you are alone. Are you in any of your friends groups at all?
USER: I've tried attending a few local events and even joined some groups online, but nothing's really clicked. It often feels like everyone already has their friend groups established, making it hard to fit in
SUPPORTER: I can understand how you feel. It can be hard to find people to connect with.
USER: Yes, in fact, I'm interested in hiking and photography. I guess I haven't really looked into groups specifically for those hobbies yet.
SUPPORTER: You're not alone! I think that's a great idea! You can go out and see them in person, and that's really awesome!
USER: It would be nice to share those experiences with others instead of always going alone.
SUPPORTER: Do you have friends or family that you could talk to?
USER: I think I'm going to join to hiking society to start making some connections
SUPPORTER: I am really interested in that. I know how hard it can be for people to find groups.
USER: Yes, but I found them in the local events, which is very good. I hope to stablish real connections. 
SUPPORTER: It is a great time. Are there anything else on your mind?
USER: I'm not sure, do you recommend me other things o connect with people? 
SUPPORTER: It's a group or a group? I know a group that you can be a group.
USER: Yes! I'll look into that. It's just been hard feeling so alone in a new place. I appreciate the suggestion.
SUPPORTER: I have you tried to join a group and you're doing well.
USER: Thanks for understanding. I guess I just needed to hear that it's okay to feel this way and that there are ways to make it better.
SUPPORTER: Well, you are you are doing well, and well, you will make it through this!
