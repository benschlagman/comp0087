USER: I can't stop thinking about the accident I witnessed a few weeks ago. It keeps replaying in my mind, and it's affecting my sleep and my daily life.
SUPPORTER: I'm so sorry to hear that. What caused the accident?
USER: A motorcycle speeding at full throttle ran over a person. When it gets quiet, the images just come flooding back, and it's overwhelming.
SUPPORTER: That must be really hard for you to deal with.
USER: Totally!  I've been trying to keep myself busy to avoid thinking about it, but it doesn't really help.
SUPPORTER: You must be feeling stressed about it. It's so hard to deal.
USER: What can I do to avoid thinking about it? 
SUPPORTER: I have been in the same situation with my boyfriend. It is so hard.
USER: I suppose speaking to someone who knows how to deal with this could help. How do I even start to look for someone like that?
SUPPORTER: Yes, you should do that. That will help you get through this.
USER: But how do I even start to look for someone like that?
SUPPORTER: How do I just look for other people like that.
USER:  I just want to find a way to stop these images and start feeling normal again.
SUPPORTER: Yes. I have done it. But I believe in you can also do the right now.
