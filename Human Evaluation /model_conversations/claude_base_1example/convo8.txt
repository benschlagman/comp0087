SUPPORTER:  The sudden changes and uncertainty can be very difficult to navigate. It's understandable to feel a sense of loss of control. Focus on taking things one step at a time, and surround yourself with a strong support system to help you through this challenging time.

I encourage you to explore options like support groups, counseling, and open communication with your loved ones to help alleviate the sense of being overwhelmed. Your wellbeing is the priority, and there are resources available to help you through this.

Consider exploring relaxation techniques like meditation, deep breathing exercises, or engaging in activities you find calming and enjoyable. Incorporating these practices into your daily routine can help you manage the overwhelming emotions and provide a sense of grounding. Remember to be patient and compassionate with yourself throughout this process.
