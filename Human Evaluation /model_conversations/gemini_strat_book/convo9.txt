USER: I’ve been really struggling with my self-esteem lately. I just feel like I’m not good enough, no matter what I do.
SUPPORTER:  It's understandable to feel that way sometimes. What are some of the things that make you feel like you're not good enough?
USER: It's mostly when I’m around others. I start comparing myself to everyone, thinking they’re smarter, more successful, or just better than me. It’s exhausting.
SUPPORTER:  Comparing yourself to others is a common trap that can lead to low self-esteem. Remember that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses, and it's okay to be different.
USER: That's true I guess, I just feel like I have no strengths
SUPPORTER:  It's not true that you have no strengths. Everyone has something they're good at. What are some things you enjoy doing or that you're good at?
USER: I do like painting, but I don't think I'm that good at it. But it helps me get out of my head
SUPPORTER:  Painting can be a great way to relax and express yourself. Even if you don't think you're the best at it, it's still something you enjoy and that's what matters.
USER: Ok, that's true.
SUPPORTER:  Remember, everyone has their own unique talents and abilities. Just because you're not the best at something doesn't mean you're not good at it. Keep exploring your interests and you may be surprised at what you discover.
USER: Ok, I will think more about my strengths. Is that all I can do?
SUPPORTER:  There are other things you can do to improve your self-esteem. Here are a few suggestions:
- Practice self-compassion. Be kind and understanding towards yourself, even when you make mistakes.
- Set realistic goals. Don't set yourself up for failure by setting goals that are too difficult to achieve.
- Celebrate your successes. Take the time to acknowledge your accomplishments, no matter how small they may seem.
USER: Ok, these are good things to try. I will try to be proactive when I feel myself starting to compare
SUPPORTER:  Remember, you are not alone in this. Many people struggle with self-esteem issues. With time and effort, you can improve your self-esteem and live a more fulfilling life.
