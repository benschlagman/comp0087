56,i did get the chance to explain my reasons a few days after the breakup. we were friendly and talked casually for a few more days and then they said they needed to space to get themselves together. we haven't really talked since then. the problem is i'm open to something in the future but i don't know that they are and i can't find the courage to ask,i have been in both situations before the one who needed space and also as the one who was broken up with. i think right now the best thing you can do for you and the person is to stick with your decision and give them time they also may need space to process and deal with the breakup and growth for themselves without really letting go you won't be able to grow in time you can have a conversation and ask but it might be six months down the road wait for them to come to you they have asked for time as you did too soon,well you are open to something in the future but it is not something that you can do from this point forward.,40,2.598918914794922,13.44919045201224
56,i think i can do that. they needed space because it was hard going from being in a relationship to being friends in a matter of days. i guess i'll just have to continue working on myself and see how things go,focusing on yourself sounds like the best thing you can do. start on that list of self improvements you want to make. connect with friends you may have lost touch with. your going to be great,just from chatting with you i can tell you have a lot to work on and i'm sure you will have a great time,40,3.1191497802734376,22.62713342738309

71,so true,"when things get stressful, meditation can be difficult. sometimes we get wrapped up so much in our emotions that trying to center yourself and focus on your breathing and the moment can be hard. one thing i've learned to be helpful when i'm stressed is to breathe in through my nose while internally counting to three and out through my mouth counting to three. the counting tends to distract my mind from whatever stressful thing i was thinking of before.",so many people are having problems with their motivation during the pandemic. i think we all need to work on our self esteem and self control.,40,3.0476070404052735,21.06487666424456

73,i think i know what you mean. it's getting worse. i feel very down.,ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. the intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse.,do you feel like you are getting worse or is it just a general feeling of low mood?,38,2.2236151444284538,9.240676935875157
73,yeah. i worry that i'll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. i'm really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest.,"firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. many people struggle with depression and it's good that you have reached out for help for this.","i have found that if i have a good day, i can avoid the stressful part of the day and focus on the good things.",32,1.827600121498108,6.218944025373459
73,any suggestions on what to do about it?,there are many reasons people have depression. it is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. the first step is recognising the problem.,i have found that staying home with my family and my friends helps me to cope with my depression and helps me find support.,36,2.8371153937445746,17.066464434132115
73,ok well there is definitely a problem.,have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment?,i suggest you try to do some self care exercises and try to take some deep breaths. you can even try meditation and meditation exercises to help you get some relief.,25,1.705440216064453,5.503807998694452
73,not really i don't want to bother other people with my problems.,if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. i think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help.,that's a good idea. i think it's great that you feel that you are not alone.,40,2.209166908,9.108125327513026
73,yeah maybe. i suppose nobody really understands but i could at least speak to them about it.,everyone has problems and it is good to talk about them because a problem shared is a problem halved. it doesn't mean the problems will go away but it might help you understand them and then be able to deal with them better.,i think it would be great to start talking to a professional and see how they can help you.,40,3.035708427429199,20.81571910369404
73,i don't want to feel like this anymore. i'm willing to at least give it a go.,i also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective solutions from a medical perspective.,i am glad to hear that. i am happy to listen and if i can help you in any way i would love to.,40,3.008818435668945,20.263443213104846
73,i haven't spoken to a doctor about this before to be clear i don't want any medication.,"are you worried that speaking to a doctor will lead to you being given medication, and you don't want this?",i can understand that. i also think that you should definitely get in touch with your doctor or a professional.,25,2.436129150390625,11.428716169740062
73,yes that's right i don't want to take any pills or anything like that.,i know that some forms of depression are caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain and medication in these cases can help. also psychologists can support with mental health which means that this would not be a rude day involves any medication at all potentially,i have been there and i am very happy with my doctor. he is a really good person and a great person to listen to and be understanding.,40,3.263236236572266,26.133976165941675
73,what do you mean be a rude day.,apologies this was a typo by autocorrect. i meant to say that this would not be a route that involves any medication at all potentially,i don't think that's a problem. i have also suffered from depression before and i was in a similar situation.,29,2.148877110974542,8.575223964110494
73,ok thanks for explaining. i think i'll speak to my sister about this. if this doesn't help i'll look into making an appointment with the psychologist maybe.,that's great. i think the first step is always the hardest but you come across as someone that is willing to seek help and i believe that if you face into this you can overcome it witht he right support.,i think you are in the right. you have the right to express yourself.,40,3.073834991455078,21.624674300480795
