2,I'm having problems with friends - or more precisely the lack of them. I don't have any.,"Oh I see. You feel as though you don't have any friend's currently? I totally get that. I feel like that a lot too, especially in these weird times we are going through. It's so hard to see people and keep relationships right now",I understand that. I have had friends that have been in a similar situation as well.,45,2.789522468,16.27324695

2,I don't think I'd want to let them know how unhappy I am to be honest,"Oh I see. Well personally, when I was going through a hard time and I felt like I didn't have any friends, I found a couple pretty cool apps that helped me out! IT sounds crazy, but there are apps specifically for finding friends. They are kind of like dating apps but it's 100% meant for friends so everyone on them has the same intentions you do. I actually found a couple close friends through apps like that. Have you heard about those or looked into them?",I understand how you feel. I am sure they will understand how they are feeling.,45,2.854560343,17.3668001

2,Yeah! They are a really good way to connect with people that you share a lot of similar interests with.,But it sounds to me that you are pretty overall sad right now.

Are you interested in making friends, or do you think it would be a great idea to do that?",45,2.500567457,12.18940897

2,The problem is that I lack the courage to go out and meet people.,"Well personally, I have struggled with putting myself down a lot and blaming myself for things that I shouldn't blame myself for. You shouldn't blame yourself for not having the courage to go meet people, or blame yourself for not having any friends!

2,"oh you mean chat online first, before actually meeting in person?","Yeah, that is what is great about those friendship apps.

3,I am Ok thanks but have an unusual issue. I think my girlfriend may be cheating on me but I'm too scared to do anything about it as I don't want her to leave me. I feel ashamed of myself but I can't help it,Being in a relationship with someone when you suspect unfaithful behavior is a rough thing to go through.,I'm sorry to hear that. I am sure you will find that you are doing a great job.,22,2.741091642,15.50390056
3,Yes it is but I should be leaving her and moving on. Problem is she is a 9 and I'm a 5 and I love her. Pretty sure she is cheating though so hopefully if I ignore it she may just leave things as they are.,"I've dealt with the same problem with my partner more than once. I love him very much and I found him to be a 9 to my 5 as well. However, the question of whether he was cheating or not was destroying my trust in him and everyone else not to mention what self-respect I had... I had to break down and talk to him about it",You can try to keep your distance and tell her that you love her and she will find a way to make you feel better.,45,2.707488166,14.99157184
3,What happened out of interest when you had the conversation?,Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist.,I had a conversation with him and he was a bit upset about it. I think he was upset with me and made excuses for him and then did not apologize.,23,4.368660305,78.93780823
3,Ignoring this will NOT help things. There is NO relief in pretending a question or concern does not exist.,"Like I said the question has arisen more than once. The first time he owned to talking to other women, but nothing more. Since that time, he denies everything.",It is possible you are just avoiding her because you are not feeling as well as you would like to feel.,35,3.848787144,46.93610197
3,I know. I'm a typical man and I like the feeling when she is on my arm. I feel like the cat that has got the cream. It's superficial and sad I know. I knew this would never last. She is just too attractive for me. Everyone told me Iwas 'punching above my weight' and now they will all be laughing if it ends.,"Honestly, its not anyone else's business. IF you're suspicions are in fact correct, then you've got to see that a loving and faithful 5 is better than a heart-breaking 10. However should you find that maybe the devils of insecurities are tricking you into thinking that she's cheating, then remember that what the two of you share o=is FOR THE TWO of you. Its a relationship, not a community project! Even mu advice, albeit in the air to help you best I can. is not more important that what matters most to YOU and HER!","How long have you been married? I have been married for almost 10 years. I've had a few friends that I've talked to about it, and it has been a very positive experience for me too.",45,4.351700507,77.6103277

3,"I'm almost certain of it, she is super protective of her phone and never used to be. She is always texting and vague when I ask who she is messaging. She goes away with work and when she does she rarely messages me. Recently she said when was going way for a work trip for three nights but when I called her office her colleague said they got back after two.","Hmm... So have you two live together? How long has this kind of behavior persisted? When you ask her about this behavior, how do you present the question and how does she react? Finally, how often do you talk with her about the situation?",I can understand your concern. It's not a matter of whether she is cheating or not. It is a matter about whether you're still friends with her.,45,3.551370917,34.8610764
3,That's just it. I kind of know she is cheating but I haven't approached it with her because I'm scared see will just leave and I'll be a laughing stock. I suppose I'm a joke either way!,"Don't get me wrong, I completely understand why you have suspicions. Really I think anyone would in the same shoes... However, as humans, we tend to either assume the best or the worst of others. There's always a margin of error present as a variable in such situations.",I understand. It's hard to make friends when you are scared of your friends. I think it's important to keep in mind that this is not the only thing that is bothering you.,45,3.425874498,30.7495235
3,very true. I suppose I have just assumed at this stage with no real evidence. do you think I should just talk to her?,Forgive me if this comes off as disrespectful... I only want to help you.,Maybe you should ask her? It sounds like you are still very trusting of her and that you are willing to talk to others about the issue.,18,3.063088735,21.39353417
3,not at all. I appreciate your candour.,"But if you feel as though you're a joke regardless, then why stay in a relationship where you're getting hurt? I know that you don't want to lose the beauty but would you not be happier with loyalty?",I know this is a tough situation but I believe that you can do it!,45,3.174555122,23.91617771
3,All this is tied up with who and I know I'm valuing the wrong things. You are right actually. I think some of this comes from my low self-esteem. having a 9 helps with that. but maybe I need to deal with it directly.,"I wholly believe you should gently but steadfastly confront her. I absolutely do not mean to suggest a dispute or argument. That will not help either. Simply ask her about the things that you KNOW aren't acceptable; lying about how long her trip was is one of them. Also, its okay to talk about how that stuff makes you feel, but try not to project your feelings as her fault. I know that it seems like they are... But she didn't MAKE you feel any specific way, even if her ACTIONS influenced how you were already feeling.",What are your feelings about the situation that you feel you have to deal directly with?,45,4.40057373,81.49761292

4,no it's just that it's a different avenue. I have done many online courses before even with the pandemic. I think it's because of the pandemic that has made me procrastinating more and being aimless and slow.,Maybe take a hour a day before you start to do something you want to do then you will feel more motivated to get it done after.,I can understand that. I can understand how you feel. I used to do online courses but now I feel like I'm not doing it enough.,29,2.627778941,13.84298964

I remember having to go through a lot of break ups during that pandemic and the same thing happened with my ex.,34,3.428390279,30.82697994

Now i lookup youtube videos of workouts and do them, and it really helps to get me going in the day.",Do you ever listen to music while you are trying to get work done? When i do that it tends to help time go faster and i get more done.,I find that I have found that yoga can help me to get motivated and get in the gym.,33,2.660913178,14.30935012
4,"And I know I can pass the courses and on time but just that I am disappointed at my performance and work ethics as I know I have done much better before.

4,"Thank you and I do agree with you on the pandemic. But this is a part of my mistake too but I think coming away from our conversation, I am more optimistic now having talked to someone about it.","Yes i would imagine that would help to, i found that before i started working out at home i was beginning to feel lazy and not getting anything done, but that has all changed now.","you are very welcome, you are very optimistic about your future.",39,2.998673072,20.05890254

5,What should I do about these two (so-called) friends?,definatly not...have you tried explaining your situation to them?,maybe you should talk to them and see if they can help you,16,3.033078671,20.76105074

You have the resources to support yourself and your friends.,29,3.82966035,46.04689574

18,I think so. Im doing mturk for a second job right now. it helps some. i don't know about getting another job,I've been in your shoes and also feel that's a good way to add a little extra income. It can really add up if left to built and used towards a specific goal.,"That's a great idea! I have heard that if you try hard enough, it will pay off!",38,3.36061036,28.806768
18,I agree 100%. Been spending it on new clothes and toiletries lately to stock up for the covid shutdown. the extra money helps alot,"It definitely can help.

Maybe designate a certain percentage for what you are using it towards now, and the rest to other bill concerns.",It sounds like you are working hard to pay your bills.,45,3.073668077,21.62106514
18,i currently do that. it's hard to have the patience to pay it off. i hate having debt hanging over my head. i like to have nice things though and they cost money,"Yes, and I have found this can be a good way to provide for the extra luxuries we like, without taking away from money that's used towards household bills.",I can see that. I have found that being lazy can be very helpful to have a bit of extra cash on hand at the moment.,35,3.477550398,32.38030597
18,absolutely. i make sure all of my household bills are paid every month. i think it will get better once these debts are paid off. i needed a lot of new things at once since the old had worn out.,"Have you tried to use some of the scripts that can be added that allows you to catch hits that are hard to get on Mturk? They can be very helpful. Also, there are forums that have all kinds of useful information for workers.",I know it sounds like you are a strong person and I hope that this will work out for you.,45,3.071807861,21.58088267
18,do i have to pay for those scripts?,You might find it useful to do a little research and add them as extensions to Chrome or whatever browser you use. They are free and pretty simple to use.,yes you can use them. I've done it before.,33,2.6409096,14.02595581
18,So I could make more money on mturk than I am now by using those?,"They have helped me in being able to get a bit more extra income. The scripts will continually try to grab the hits for you and then put them in your queue if they catch them. It's easier and faster than trying to grab them over and over. The forums can a large amount of help too. Perhaps try MTS. They also can show exactly how much you end up making per hour, filter by monetary amount of hits, etc",Yes. It's a good start. I think it's a great idea.,45,3.636560059,37.96102815
18,MTS is a script? Which script should I use?,"Of course, I hope it can be of use too you! One I use is Mechanical Turk Suite, which is an extension. I think you can look up as a search for extensions, scripts etc. Or Mturk forums and find out tons of help!",I use the free one from the forums. It helps me to get the extra income I need from my own money.,45,3.603000895,36.70822686

I just can't get over missing my partner because they were great to me, I just needed to be alone.",I think you are feeling a loss even though you feel that at this time you need to be alone to focus on your own growth. When you had the conversation about this breakup were you honest about why you need the space and that your problem was not with the relationship but with maybe the timing. I think with communication and after growth perhaps by keeping the door open with this person maybe you can have some sort of relationship in the future even if its friendship or maybe more. You are doing what is right for yourself at the given time,"I think that you need to focus more on your goals and goals, and to focus your self growth, and you will be happy to be in the same situation as you are now.",45,2.930282254,18.73291719
56,I did get the chance to explain my reasons a few days after the breakup. We were friendly and talked casually for a few more days and then they said they needed to space to get themselves together. We haven't really talked since then. The problem is I'm open to something in the future but I don't know that they are and I can't find the courage to ask,I have been in both situations before the one who needed space and also as the one who was broken up with. I think right now the best thing you can do for you and the person is to stick with your decision and give them time they also may need space to process and deal with the breakup and growth for themselves without really letting go you won't be able to grow in time you can have a conversation and ask but it might be six months down the road wait for them to come to you they have asked for time as you did too soon,"You are doing the right thing. You need to know that you have to be open to someone for a while, and you can always be open and honest about your reasons.",45,2.985637071,19.79911167
56,I think I can do that. They needed space because it was hard going from being in a relationship to being friends in a matter of days. I guess I'll just have to continue working on myself and see how things go,Focusing on yourself sounds like the best thing you can do. Start on that list of self improvements you want to make.

60,Yes after one or two statements they give up.,Okay so they ask you a couple of times and then they move on. That's good that they don't push you too much. Certainly keep with it if not drinking helps you to not make bad decisions. I'm sure you have other interests in life that maybe you could drag your friends out to enjoy so that might help...sober fun! Also if you find that you're struggling with not drinking that might be a time to look for support. Maybe see a therapist as there may be psychological reasons you can not refrain from drinking.

65,It's been a pretty crazy year. I'm mostly bummed because of my work.,"It has been a really weird year hasn't it? Don't worry, I think it's been the same for all of us. Would you like to tell me more details?",I'm sorry to hear that. Is there anything specific you are feeling sad about?,37,2.115593575,8.294507719
65,"Sure, when covid hit my company did a round of layoffs and also cut everyone else's pay by 10%... I was bummed but I kind of understood because I knew our business would be impacted by closures. I found out recently that my boss (the VP) is intentionally making our impact seem worse so he can keep our salaries reduced and overall cost lower so that he can get a higher bonus next year.",That really sucks! I can understand why you are angry and anxious about this and you have every right to be!,"Oh no! I'm sorry to hear that. I know how stressful that can be, but I am glad that you are feeling better now.",24,2.339899063,10.38018877

I know how frustrating it can be when you are upset about something.,13,3.574619293,35.68103422
65,I don't think so... He's the VP there isn't anyone I can go to above him,That is genuinely unfair.

65,That is genuinely unfair. Have you looked into getting free - or low cost at least - advice about making a formal complaint?,It really should not be legal for your boss to be taking advantage of workers like this,"Yes, that is a very good idea. I have found that when I talk to people, they tend to give me advice about how to get over it and how to be better.",18,2.709838867,15.026854
65,I don't know if it is or not... I used my EAP benefit through work where you can talk to a councilor for free (5 visits) and they said that it's unfortunate but they didn't think it was illegal.,"I am very sorry to hear that, that sounds extremely unfair to me. Have you considered looking for another job? I realise it's a very difficult time to be looking for work right now though",It sounds like you have a good sense of self control and are really understanding of the situation. You seem to have a great understanding of how you are feeling and are making good progress.,40,2.111519623,8.260785029

Us poorer people are not doing very well though!,Oh no! I'm so sorry to see that! It must be hard to work as a public safety officer and be there to make sure your safety is the best for everyone.,16,4.581930161,97.7027944
65,Well yes fair point! Us poorer people are not doing very well though!,Have you tried to talk with any of your coworkers about this? I would suggest that it might help.,"I'm sure you're going to have a great year, especially if you're not feeling too bad about it!",22,2.047283866,7.746831075
65,"That's a good call, I've got a work buddy who I feel somewhat comfortable talking with. I may try and reach out to him",I really think you should. You have a legitimate grievance and being able to discuss it with people who understand might help a lot.,Do you have any other issues? I think you will be able to find some work if you're open to it.,27,2.832007797,16.97951804
65,I feel a little guilty about sharing what I know because I almost feel like ignorance is bliss at this point. But then I feel guilty for keeping that info,I feel that people have the right to know what is being done and will be happy you told them.,That is a good idea! It's hard to tell with all the things going on but I think you will find that you are making the right choices in life.,22,2.776797208,16.06747766

71,so true,"When things get stressful, meditation can be difficult. Sometimes we get wrapped up so much in our emotions that trying to center yourself and focus on your breathing and the moment can be hard. One thing I've learned to be helpful when I'm stressed is to breathe in through my nose while internally counting to three and out through my mouth counting to three.

73,I am suffering from low mood and general depression. I don't know what is causing it or how to get over it but it is getting excited down (obviously) and there doesn't appear to be any real reason behind it.,I'm sorry to hear that. Have you been feeling this way for a while now or is this a recent issue?,I understand that feeling. Have you considered meditation?,25,1.360275421,3.897266544
73,I felt this way for a while actually isn't a recent change it's been building slowly over time.,Have you been feeling worse in terms of your depression over this time or has the intensity of your feelings stayed pretty much the same?,Have you tried doing something to help you get over this?,27,3.225285283,25.16075106
73,I think I know what you mean. It's getting worse. I feel very down.,Ok so you have felt like this for a while and it is getting worse not better. The intensity of your feelings is getting stronger and you worry that this will continue to get worse.,It can be hard to take the long walk and take a deep breath. Do you think you will be able to get through this?,38,2.368375477,10.68002823
73,Yeah. I worry that I'll just keep feeling even more down and depressed. I'm really having a bad time and struggle to get out of bed to be honest.,"Firstly, you are not alone in feeling this way. Many people struggle with depression and it's good that you have reached out for help for this.",Do you think you could take a step back and tell yourself that you're better off?,31,2.096397646,8.1368054
73,Any suggestions on what to do about it?,There are many reasons people have depression. It is a recognised medical condition and the good news is that there is help out there. The first step is recognising the problem.,You are not the only one. I have found that the best way to deal with depression is to keep on going and just keep on feeling depressed.,36,2.609157138,13.58759356
73,Ok well there is definitely a problem.,Have you spoken to friends and family about this? do they know how much you are struggling with it at the moment?,"I understand, there is a lot going on in your life right now, and that is something you can really get out from this. It seems like you are having a difficult time and that it is affecting you too much to",25,1.949248657,7.02340861
73,not really I don't want to bother other people with my problems.,if people care about you then they will be happy to give you the time and listen to how you are feeling at the moment. I think it will be a really good move to speak to family or friends tell them how you are feeling and talk it through this might really help.,I understand that you are feeling down. I know that it can be hard to get through this. Do you have friends?,45,2.56875729,13.0495975
73,Yeah maybe. I suppose nobody really understands but I could at least speak to them about it.,everyone has problems and it is good to talk about them because a problem shared is a problem halved. It doesn't mean the problems will go away but it might help you understand them and then be able to deal with them better.,I'm sure it will work out in the long run for you.,45,2.928690592,18.70312444
73,I don't want to feel like this anymore. I'm willing to at least give it a go.,I also think that it will be worse to get in touch with your doctor or a medical professional. these people are trained to deal with problems like yours and will be able to offer effective Solutions from a medical perspective.,What about the other person? Do they have any reason to feel ashamed that you are having this problem?,44,3.180846474,24.06711713
73,I haven't spoken to a doctor about this before to be clear I don't want any medication.,"are you worried that speaking to a doctor will lead to you being given medication, and you don't want this?",you can always talk to a medical doctor and see what they say,24,2.486395518,12.01787973
73,yes that's right I don't want to take any pills or anything like that.,I know that some forms of depression are caused by an imbalance of chemicals in the brain and medication in these cases can help. Also psychologists can support with mental health which means that this would not be a rude day involves any medication at all potentially,What do you think is going on with this medication?,45,4.00262146,54.74146466
73,what do you mean be a rude day.,apologies this was a typo by autocorrect. I meant to say that this would not be a route that involves any medication at all potentially,maybe you should look into your options. i've been in a similar situation and it wasnt a rude one,30,3.100221252,22.20286318
73,ok thanks for explaining. I think I'll speak to my sister about this. if this doesn't help I'll look into making an appointment with the psychologist maybe.,That's great. I think the first step is always the hardest but you come across as someone that is willing to seek help and I believe that if you face into this you can overcome it witht he right support.,okay i hope it works out for you.,45,3.163685438,23.65762418

75,What kind of tools would you recommend I use to get through this,"Well, falling back on savings while you look for more work is good for a while.

78,I think I will tell everyonr in our circle to fall back and let her come to us when she is ready.,You could also try talking to your hurt friend like this and ask her if she thinks the other friend truly meant to hurt her. I bet she knows that wasn't the case.,"Yes, it is a good idea to be prepared.",37,2.920003118,18.54134527

79,Hello how are you?,"I am good, how are you?","I am good, thank you for asking. I am here for you.",9,0.646765179,1.909354409

79,Friends not being there for me when I need emotional support. They also do not pay for their stuff when we go out to eat or go to the bar as well.,"So just to make sure I understand, you are having issues with your friends not being there for you emotionally and you are worried about them taking advantage of you when you go out.",I have also had this happen. I was also in the same situation.,37,1.709262539,5.524885585
79,Yes that is exactly it. Just sucks not having that emotional support,I completely understand what you are feeling. Have you tried to talk to your friends about your concerns? It helps to clear the air and make sure everyone understands everyone elses perspective,I understand that. It is hard to feel comfortable when you are not there for your friends.,36,2.389862484,10.91199327
79,I have and it seems that they just tell me what I would like to hear! It sucks when I am always there for them when they need me but they cannot do the same.,"I have had the same problems in the past with some friends not being there for me when I need it, so I completely understand where you're coming from.",Have you spoken to your friend about it? That is a good thing to do.,33,1.722004746,5.595735255
79,It's good to know that I am not the only one going through this. What is your advice from experience with this?,Do you have anyone else to talk to about what you're going through?

79,That is definitely helpful. I will look into being more productive and also doing more hobbies around the house to help clear my mind. Any hobbies that you do now that really help?,"I enjoy building model cars in my free time, it really does a good job of keeping me occupied. I also find that reading helps a lot too!",I think I have found that the hobbies that I enjoy are the ones that help me get better.,32,2.735716105,15.42078237
79,Sounds good to me. I will take up building something...maybe turn it into a business as well. Thank you for the advice.,Not a problem! I am glad I was able to talk to you tonight!,Good luck! I am glad I could help!,17,1.570497288,4.809039079

80,I have been feeling terrible about the death of my dad. It would have been his birthday last week and that makes it even worse.,"Oh no... I am sorry to hear that. It must be devastating.

80,"He was only in his early sixties but he suffered a number of health problems, including early onset dementia.","That is rough, both for you and him. I know it's meaningless to tell you not to be sad, however, you can think that he's not in a better place",I know how you feel. It's really hard to find a solution to this. Do you have any family members you can talk to about it?,37,3.060457797,21.33732308
80,I presume you mean now and not not ;). Though I simply am not a believer. It just made me think how meaningless life was.,"oh sorry, yyeah I mean now. Life is... fleeting isn't it? I sometimes think it's meaningless too",I know how you feel. I've been in similar situation. I was feeling the same way when my son died last year. It's been very difficult for me and I know how hard it can be.,25,4.329721375,75.9231295
80,I do not really know what to do about my feelings. They are not going away.,"I feel you, coping with losing your loved ones is never easy.

80,"I think that what you said there was very wise. Maybe it's worse, in some ways, to feel that your grief has lessened.. there is guilt that comes with that.","I don't think people can completely get over that, you just get used to the pain of not having them around","Do not let the guilt consume you. If you do not feel that you are better off now, do you think you can try to help yourself with things that you can do at home?",24,2.731057485,15.34910989
80,"Whilst it hurts to think about him being dead, I think that it would hurt more if I had totally forgotten about him and did not think about him every day.","I just need you to know that whatever your feeling is, it's completely normal and you shouldn't feel guilty for having it","What about your feelings about him? I know that you can feel the same way, but in the long run you can live with them.",26,2.705908555,14.96790969
80,It is just - very hard. I keep thinking about all the times I disagreed with him or did not appreciate him enough and I never got to tell him how much I loved him.,Your dad wouldn't want to see you grieving everyday either. You should live the way you know he'd love to see,"Yes, it is very hard, but you are able to tell how you feel and feel about it.",25,3.790533752,44.28002854
80,Your dad wouldn't want to see you grieving everyday either. You should live the way you know he'd love to see,I believe he knew you loved him regardless how much you two argued,"I agree with you on this one, I don't believe that he will die alone. He will be a hero",14,4.04265213,56.97725369
80,I know that he did :). I had just not expected to lose him at such a comparatively young age. He did not get to enjoy his retirement!,That's sad when he spent all his time taking care of the family and yet could not enjoy his free time,That is a very good thing to hear! I wish you the best!,23,3.327887162,27.87937483
80,Yes. I think it would have been easier to deal with had he not immediately descended into very bad health as soon as he retired and had had time to have some fun.,"have you considered seeking therapist? We almost never think of that service, but in a lot of case, people actually need help from professionals when grieving",I think that you should let your dad know that you are glad he is still there.,30,4.059695943,57.95668627
80,I can't really afford to have therapy at the moment. Also I know that my dad was just have considered it to be a waste of money - he was very careful with money.,"he seemed to be a great man. Instead of regretting what happened, celebrate how great of a person he was",I think that is a great idea. You are probably right that you need to consider a therapist to see how you can get a second opinion from your parents.,24,3.210696856,24.7963597
80,That is a really sensible suggestion and it cheers me up to think of it. You have been a really great help to me.,I'm glad I could be some help for you,i'm glad you are feeling better and I hope you will find a way to help.,11,1.75071647,5.758727151

81,That's great. My job refused my request to continue to work from home. So I was pretty much forced to go into a school where the cases are growing.,I imagine that's very overwhelming and stressful to think about. Are there at least some type of protocols and protection in place for your well-being?,That must be hard to deal with. What's going on?,31,3.119617093,22.63770985
81,I fear that I will bring this home to my family and I will not survive it. I have pre existing conditions.,I'm sorry that you're having to deal with such stressful circumstances.

I would love to hear more about your situation.,40,2.61941185,13.72764729
81,I'm sorry that you're having to deal with such stressful circumstances. You can only control what you can control.

81,Teachers are not cared about its just about pleasing the parents it crazy. I can't quit because there not much to go into now,Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you've already attempted to discuss it with?,That is a very long time. You should be able to see your parents and tell them that you want to go to school and that you are not there to take care of it.,23,3.487829789,32.71487243
81,Is there someone else you could go to about this? Besides whoever you've already attempted to discuss it with?,Yeah you're right.

81,"I've tried contacting HR a few times but I have never received a call back, or my emails answered.",I mean all you can do is try your best to stay safe but I would continue to reach out to people higher up and see about getting something done. They probably get a lot of calls and emails right now because of everything going on but I would keep trying,Have you tried reaching out to your principal for help?,45,2.895433214,18.09133716
81,Very true. I'm going to keep trying. Thanks for talking with me letting out what I feel has made me feel a little better.,Thank you for talking with me too! I hope it has helped some.

82,"Absolutely not. I'm not even in California yet, where I know my usage will explode. It's just difficult managing the realities of quarantine with the effects of the marijuana","Well, do you worry about your consumption?

82,"It was recently legalized in our state. My wife and I were actually one of the first people in line to buy it legally last year, before the pandemic. It is a major part of our lives.",I am in the UK. It's sort of a grey area... police won't really do anything but you can't buy it over the counter,I think you should be able to get medical help for free if you have any concerns about your health.,30,3.275889079,26.46674605
82,One of the best things about legalization has been the expurgation of criminal records for incarcerated people jailed on marijuana charges. I'm very grateful that these atrocities have been rectified at least partially.,Yes I would be too. Even twenty five years ago in my student days it was rare for anyone to be prosecuted for pot. The US seems to be really strict on it tho,Well I am sure that will help with your stress and anxiety.,37,3.719202402,41.23149485

I vote for local councillors tho,"Ah I see. Well, the fact that you're a mayor is probably good enough for you, as you've been in a good place for a long time, but I think you're going to need to be more careful",37,3.094452317,22.07514504
82,"Oh, I take it to mean that you are anti-Khan? If you feel like you'd need to vote for mayor in London",I like Khan :),"If you're not sure how to feel about it, you might want to try and find a local councillor who might be willing to let you know about it.",5,4.628336334,102.3436568

90,Hello there. I'm suffering with increased depression and I'm not quite clear why.,I'm sorry to hear that. Is there any change in your routine as of lately?,Do you feel depressed? I know a lot of people who are suffering from depression and are struggling with it.,19,2.071336445,7.935421289
90,No not really. I have suffered from depression before but it seems to have spiked recently. The only thing that is different these days is lockdown. I think that's the same for everyone.,"These past few months has been extremely difficult. In the past, what did you do for your depression?",I understand that you are experiencing a lot of stress. I can understand that. It's really difficult for everyone to cope with stress.,22,2.421283028,11.26029733
90,I saw a psychiatrist face to face but only once every month. I've always had a low mood but now I'm anxious that it will continue to get worse.,Talking to a professional is always ideal. Is there a way to see that psychiatrist again?,Is there anything else that you can do to help you cope with this?,19,3.324506458,27.78528207
90,"Since lockdown haven't spoken to her but maybe she can do a video call. At the start it was fine, I was feeling just as I always have but I don't want this to get any worse. What if she isn't available?","It wouldn't hurt to try and reach out. If she isn't available, there are other services.",Maybe she is a counsellor? She may have had a history of depression.,22,2.141958757,8.516102276
90,What like support groups etc? I'm also sure this isn't just related to lockdown and not seeing my specialist. It's weird and a little concerning to be honest.,"Not necessarily support groups, but more like psychiatry apps where a trained professional is available via chat, or video and its specifically through the app.","I can understand your frustration. I know how frustrating it can be to have to deal with this, but it's important to take things out of your control.",29,4.368402415,78.91745362
90,I hadn't thought of that. I know there are a few of these nowadays.,"There a lot more since Covid began in March, so it's worth as a backup plan if your doctor isn't available. Sometimes its good to have options.",Perhaps you could try looking into a therapist? They can be very helpful and they can help with this situation.,34,3.181240755,24.0766082
90,I'll start a plan and seeing if I can see my usual therapist and go from there. Sometimes it just helps talk it through depression stops you from seeing things clearly. Do you have any experience with mental health issues?,After my son was born I developed Post Partem depression and anxiety. It wasn't until almost a year and half after he was born to realize it.,Yes I have been in a similar situation. I've been in similar situation too. It was very frustrating to see a therapist but I found it really helped.,32,3.559096813,35.13145255
90,That must have been difficult to deal with. Mental health affects so many people in so many ways. It's good that it's recognised these days at least.,"It was. Luckily I had my doctor to help me. Family members meant well but chalked it up to ""that's what its like to be a mom"" but it is more than that.",It's hard to feel better after all. It must be hard for you to take care of yourself.,41,3.483962268,32.58859134
90,I think this is why it's always best to see a professional. I really should try to reconnect with mine.,"I agree. There is a lot of well meaning advice out there, but its best to see a professional to really help you.","And yes, that's a great idea. I am glad you are feeling better.",27,2.414999503,11.18976479
90,"Thanks for the chat, it has helped me put things in perspective.","I'm glad I could help. I hope you get to speak with your psychiatrist, or at least find a good one through an app.",Thank you. I am glad I could help.,29,2.349127145,10.47642133

91,and I'm struggling with anxiety,"Ah that sounds tough, why exactly are you stressed?",Is there anything specific that you'd like to talk about?,12,3.014403343,20.37692928
91,I know I'm going to badly because I haven't been learning well during the pandemic,"Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse.",That is a very difficult situation. Do you think you could help with your exams?,17,2.496935676,12.14521999
91,"Okay, I understand, I see how that can also make your anxiety worse.","Currently, on a scale of 1-10 how well are you understanding your course material?",Have you tried taking a break from school? That can help you cope with this.,19,3.72381913,41.42228953
91,"Probably 4. My roommates are just so loud and inconsiderate, I can't make any progress studying.",That's completely normal you haven't made any progress. That would make things so hard and I applaud you for coming so far with that going on!,"I understand, a lot of people are stressed about school exams.",31,3.232701948,25.34805364
91,I guess so. But if I fail or do badly on my exams it's really not going to be good. I'm on a scholarship and have to keep above a 3.0 gpa,Would you say your problems start with your roommates?,"Oh I see, so you're a student in the UK?",12,3.318586032,27.62126733
91,"They're the biggest problem right now. But I think having to learn from home is the main problem. It's so hard in a tiny room with just a laptop. No library, no office hours, no study groups.","I completely understand, the same goes for me. It can be hard to keep up with grade expectations especially when money is on the line",Do you have any friends who are at your school that you could talk to about your concerns?,28,2.570828574,13.07665493
91,Are you a student too?,"Yes, and I completely get it! Its so hard to self-manage without the right resources",I am a student myself. I have had to go through a lot of stress in college. I am glad that I could help you!,21,3.427808852,30.80906154
91,"When the pandemic first started, we didn't have grades, and that was really helpful","Ah and then they started rolling in, correct?",I think the only way to deal with this is to talk to your professors and see if they would have any other suggestions on how to get your grades up,11,4.647882635,104.3637753
91,"I feel like until way more people get the vaccine, we're still in the pandemic","Me too, unfortunately for us, universities don't seem t have the same sentiments.","I think it's been a really hard year to go through, but I think we're all going through it.",18,4.037115733,56.66267659

91,"For starters, I think it would benefit you to eliminate the more closer problems: your roommates",Have you tried talking to them?,I think that is a good idea. It would help to have a roommate that you can talk to and see if they would allow you to study in your room or in your own room.,8,1.592377305,4.915420503
91,"Thanks for that suggestion. I have tried, but they are immature and just want to party. I've started staying in my room which helps, but is very isolating. I wish I could afford my own place","Makes sense, isolation makes it hard to form that connection. I can see your dilemma",It's really difficult to be isolated in a room. The pandemic has been really isolating and it has made things so much harder for everyone.,19,3.310567755,27.40067794
91,"Makes sense, isolation makes it hard to form that connection. I can see your dilemma",Are you currently working?,What about studying in a classroom? That seems like a great idea!,6,2.565558751,13.00792454
92,I face the situation of me being sad because I thought we could let this fight go over time but instead it has lead to us breaking up,Can you tell me more about the fight?,I am sorry to hear that. Do you have any plans for the rest of the year?,10,1.217207909,3.377743587
92,"Yes, so we had a fight previously over Thanksgiving Break about how I woke her up from her sleep and she kicked me out of her place at like 4 in the morning. Then I pick her up to go try and get breakfast...then she starts punching me while I drive so I pull over. Then she keeps hitting me until I tell her to stop.",Breakups are usually sad for at least one of the couple. Is your sadness because of missing her or being alone or something else?,"I can understand that you are fighting a losing battle, but the fact that you were able to let it go, especially after she started punching you, is a big deal to me.",28,3.655294418,38.67890722
92,It is because I do really miss her. I really hate that our fight got to that level to where we broke up,"Breakups are hard, but it sounds like she was violent",I'm sorry to hear that. I know how hard it is to fight with someone you love so much. It's really hard to beat someone you like. I can see how you feel.,13,3.134243892,22.97126052
92,Yeah she was a little violent. I was honestly a little scared for my life for a second but people make mistakes.,Have you talked since then?,I can see how that could be frustrating. I have had a similar situation where I broke up with my wife because I was too immature and she was upset at me for asking for help.,7,2.920535496,18.55121891
92,She was very open to talking and such but I just wasn't ready because my family found out about what happened and are worried about my safety,"If safety is an issue, then I think that maybe moving on is a good decision",Have they been able to talk to you about it?,18,3.187380049,24.22487624
92,I know but I am so sad because the break up was so quick and we did not really have closure after the whole fight happened between us. I still keep on thinking about her.,"I suggest that you do things that will help you get over her., like going out with friends or a new hobby. Don't be in a hurry to get into a new relationship, but if one happens that would be great too.",It sounds like you are really feeling sorry for her.

92,"It's way harder to do than say though. No, this is not my first breakup with a woman but I felt like she was the one for me","Breakups are not always the end, but they usually happen for a reason, and whenever violence is involved it is usually better to move on",So you want to get through this? Do you think you should talk to her about it?,29,3.000861069,20.10283941
92,Maybe you're right! Just need to get productive and get my mind off of her for good since she was violent,I suggest you start trying to have fun with others and getting yourself out there where there will be new opportunities,I think that you need to take the time to learn what you're talking about.,22,3.354220304,28.62327802
92,I will definitely try. I know it will be hard because I am upset still but sometimes I guess moving on is the only thing that you can do in this situation,The sadness will eventually pass and I am sure there is someone out there that will be a good match for you,"I understand. But you can also try to make sure that you are not upset by what she did, even if it was an accident.",23,2.483272055,11.98040088

93,"Yes, it is very important, I just felt if I called I would be bothering her :(",Could she she is arranging the house to fit her style,I would suggest speaking with your friend about how you feel and maybe try to get her to know that you are sorry about her.,12,5.191242854,179.6917448
93,"That is possible, and it is a HUGE house, 4 stories",Have you tried to visit her and see if you can help,Do you think it would be better to move on from her than to another place?,13,2.152030358,8.60230644

125,That is very hard to have feelings for someone who does not feel the same way. I have been there myself.,Have you tried to put distance between yourself and this friend?,I understand that.

125,"No, it has been difficult with the whole Corona virus thing. I have taken a large income hit and also I'm having trouble finding someone who wants to actually go do something.",Yes the Corona virus has really put a damper on all kinds of normal activities. Have you thought about joining like a group with similar interests as yourself? Maybe look for a local group that has a Facebook page and you can start with building friendships just by chatting online or even on the public page itself. Some of the best lasting relationships start out as friends with similar interests and then they blossom.,I am so sorry to hear that. That is absolutely awful. Have you tried looking for a new friend?,45,2.760759311,15.8118445

134,very true. not sure if he just likes me as as friend or if he wants me back. we dated then he broke up. then he asked me out again and didn't see me cuz he was busy. now he's asking me to be on the board with him. not sure if he has other motives to try to get back with me,That must be incredibly confusing for you. How does this make you feel overall?,I am sorry to hear that. I'm sure you are going through the same thing.,17,2.270782246,9.686975452

That is a very important step in trying to get out of this situation.,17,1.605068431,4.978200255
134,cuz the first time he asked me out i was helping him with the board. i think it might be a way for him to spend time with me and then work his way back in. not sure if he will or not though. time will tell,It is okay to feel confused and perhaps even angry about this. Have you considered talking to him and asking him straight out what his intentions are?,I would say that you are probably not getting your life back on track but he might be able to take the board and take some time off.,30,2.276791636,9.745363526
134,yes but i'm afraid what i'll hear,I realise that this must be difficult but isn't it best to get things out into the open?,Perhaps you could try to talk to him directly and ask him if he wants to work with you or see if he could work with your friend?,21,2.674277896,14.5018742
134,it is but hes already hurt me before. i feel i'll find out sooner or later anyways. that way i can save face,I think it might be best for you to make a clean break.

134,yes and i think he is using me to a degree also,Let me get this straight - you do have feelings for him but you are confused and you think that there's an element of mutual manipulation.,I'm sure he's doing his best to help you.,29,3.563938535,35.30196173
134,yes,You are definitely not the only person to feel this way!,So you think you would rather have him in your life than someone else?,13,1.889831983,6.618256609
134,what it comes down to is im wondering if he has feelings for me,I feel that you are paying too much attention to your position on the board.,I think it is important to ask yourself if he feels that he is not the best fit for you.,17,2.002438489,7.407096218
134,i feel it gives me an advantage i want at the moment.,But that is rather manipulative of you.,I think you are doing a great job and you deserve to be paid enough.,9,3.510812336,33.47545004
134,if you were me you would forget about him and the board,Yes I definitely would do that.,i am glad that i was able to help you. I hope you will find the right person soon.,8,2.32930851,10.27083689
134,okay. i'll try to lay low and walk away from it,I think it's time for a clear severance. Do you have any other people you are interested in? Any hobbies?,I think you are a good person and I hope things will work out for you soon.,26,2.857438894,17.41686334
134,yes but it's less than before cuz of Covid lockdowns. so it makes me more susceptible to this- if that makes sense,Ah I hear you.

134,not really. i just felt that if he stayed with me i wouldn't have slept with his friend and almost did with his other one,I am not sure what to say that will help your problem and give you closure.,"I think you should get over it. You are not going to get over this, it is not something that you can control.",18,2.602883233,13.50261314

137,Hi I am so sad my boyfriend was cheating and broke up with me when I found out. I don't think I can ever be happy again.,I am sorry to hear that. reading your opening statement it sounds like you are now suffering from low self-esteem is that true?,"I'm so sorry to hear that. I know how hard it can be, especially when you break up with your boyfriend.",28,3.365143912,28.93766148
137,I have always had problems with low self esteem this makes it worse. I have lost interest in everything I can barely make myself go to work.,do you think if you knew the reasons why the relationship ended it would help you deal with things a lot better?,Do you have any hobbies or interests that you enjoy doing?,24,2.628275712,13.84986814
137,"Maybe, why would he cheat? I have seen her she is not that pretty. I thought something was going on the last few months but he kept telling me everything was fine and that it was all my imagination.",remember the fact that he cheated is not your fault. if he entered into a committed relationship with you you should not be cheating. if things aren't right you should be talking this through with you before deciding to move on and see someone else.,maybe he's not really honest with you and you are just looking for a reason to not feel that way.,45,3.327815077,27.87736522
137,"I thought I was a good girlfriend, I was loyal, nice to his friends, kept the house nice, cooked for him, he never said he was unhappy he just started having to work nights and weekends a lot with no overtime he said he was salary now. I must just be unlovable.","have you tried getting back out there and dating again? just because he didn't want to have an honest relationship with you, doesn't mean that nobody else does. also in my message above I have made a couple of autocorrect errors, apologies for that.","He's not wrong. I think you should give him more time to think about it, and maybe he will see how you are feeling.",45,3.23300137,25.35564455
137,"I trusted what he told me despite my gut feeling which turned out to be right. I thought we were so perfect together, I don't want him back I could never trust him again, I am not sure I could trust any guy right now, I am so hurt and confused. I don't ever want to feel like this again.","relationship issues, especially when they and suddenly can be one of the most stressful periods in an adults life. you are not alone in that other people have been through similar experiences themselves",i can understand that you are feeling this way. i think you should trust that you will be okay.,37,3.936489208,51.23839782
137,"This was the first guy I ever lived with, I thought we would get married one day. How do people make it through the pain, it actually hurts.",Do you have someone who you can talk to about this to support you?,"It is not that difficult, I have had people who have struggled with the same thing, and I have personally experienced a similar situation. It can be very frustrating when you feel the pain of a breakup and don't know how",16,1.913802981,6.778819565
137,"I have a couple acquaintances at work but I wouldn't want to discuss my personal life with, my mom said to have a good cry but I almost couldn't stop once I started. He was my best friend and who I talked to once we got together I didn't seem to need anyone else which looks like a mistake now. That is why I am here for support.","Ok I understand. It is normal to be upset in a situation like this. When I ask if there is someone to talk to, I meant perhaps a friend or someone who has experienced a similar breakup. There are also support groups out there that can really help. Getting your emotions out and seeing that others struggle with the same issue may be a very good thing.",I am so sorry to hear that. I'm so sorry that your family is making you feel that way.,45,2.828820631,16.92548766
137,Have you ever had a break up of a serious relationship or know someone who has? Does the aching inside ever get better? How long will it take?,"When I was younger, my girlfriend cheated on me. We were together for 4 years. For me, it turned to anger not sadness, I was so angry that she did that to me. I realised that if she was capable of doing this, it's better that I found out now, rather than when we were engaged or married. I loved her but after she cheated, I couldn't stand the sight of her. I completely understand the feelings you are experiencing. The good news is that I have since met someone wonderful, we have children and I am now very happy.","Yes, it can be a bit rough but you can do it.",45,2.978094482,19.65033688
137,I am sorry that happened to you but glad it turned out well in the end. You have a good point that it is better to know now than after we got married. I do have a nice neighbor who expressed concern when he noticed my boyfriend was gone. He said if I ever needed someone to talk to he was there. I thought he was just being nice. Maybe I should go talk to him some time maybe he was sincere.,"I think that that would be a good idea! for info, In terms of how long it takes to get over it. I have read a statistic that is takes half the length of the relationship to truly get over it. Personally I think it does depend on the person and how things end in terms of the breakup.",Do you think it would be better for her to let him know that he is being honest with you?,45,3.401023356,29.99477969
137,"Thank you for checking on that for me, I hope it is quicker I would hate to feel this way that long. I think I will go see him he is home right now.

I think that would be a good idea to have a conversation with the fiance and try to get some closure on the situation.,30,2.699492137,14.87217677
149,No I am ending my friendship with him. That is what is best.,"I think it might be as well if you cannot control it. I do have to ask though, are you happy with your Fiance?",Ok.

If you are worried about it, then take your time to relax and enjoy the rest of your day.",25,4.134544678,62.46114464

Nearly thirty years on and I still do!!,I can understand the frustration with that. I know how difficult it can be to be with people like you.,29,4.02609858,56.04184143

151,I invested a lot of money in a business she wanted to do. She took the money and ran.,Dating can definitely complicate things.. Oh my gosh..... that is horrible. Surely there is something you can do to try to get your money back.,So you feel you have lost a lot? That must be hard to deal with.,32,3.144019842,23.19692768
151,What do you suggest?,Did you sign anything? or have proof of what happened?,"Just to be clear, that is a lot. I suggest getting a solicitor and finding out if the person is a friend or not.",13,3.750048124,42.52312833
151,Hello?,What was the business? It depends on your location but I'm sure just on the transaction alone that shows some kind of intent. or text messages saying it was for a specific purpose?,How long have you been dating her? I think you should have an idea of what to do to get back to her and her. She has been very supportive and helpful.,38,3.963321083,52.63183072
151,A cat cafe.

151,It is. I don't want to go to the police. I think they are all corrupt and raciest.,I would say 80K is worth speaking to a lawyer about it. I'm sorry you are so conflicted. I would not call the police because you willingly gave it to her. I would hire a lawyer to handle it.,That is really hard to imagine. I can understand how you feel about it. I am glad you are having a good day and I hope things get better for you.,45,2.844996474,17.20149801
151,That's great advice. I will do that. I have a mutual friend that is a lawyer.,I would not talk to a mutual friend about this at all....,So you can legally do that if she feels like it.

162,"Yeah, 2020 has been a crazy year. I've been doing Mturk here and there. I plan on doing it more. It helps me stay productive.","Yeah it helps, just forcing yourself to have goals, for sure. I've been determined to hit a number on MTurk and exercise every time I'm feeling tired, instead of taking a nap because my boss can't see me, lol. I would definitely say just start setting goals and try to look forward to 2021 being better.",I totally understand. I'm currently doing a bit of mturk and I feel like I've got more control over my work and life than I do a lot.,45,3.697274441,40.33721295
162,"Okay, I hear you. Thanks. Yeah, I guess I have to really force myself.","Force yourself at first, then the ""body in motion, stays in motion"" law will take over. :)",No problem! Have a great day! :) Have a good one :),23,4.800137395,121.5271136

162,"Okay okay. cool. That's a helpful concept. I'm going to force myself to get up and then hopefully my body will get used to it. Yes, that's true. I hate ending the day knowing I've bummed it out","One of the things I've noticed about 2020 and I think this contributes is that this year has taken away almost all incentives...you know before it would be like, ""I'm looking forward to this concert, or this movie coming out next weekend."" So, when you aren't planning things and don't have these milestones throughout the year of events breaking up the monotony, it stinks.","I know, I'm in the same boat. Sometimes it's just easier to set goals and be focused on yourself.",45,4.533970473,93.12758852
162,"Yes, I agree. I used to go to at least one concert every year. Now that's out of the question. It gets boring and a little depressing. Hopefully 2021 will be better.","I'm sure it will be. Definitely try tomorrow morning to get up and exercise and maybe hit the MTurk hard, also hobbies definitely help and being at home is a great time to learn new skills.","It's not like 2020 is going to be anything like 2021, right?",43,3.4776441,32.38334022
162,I will definitely. I just got to get up and get with it. I'm really in need of some exercise so I'll do that too. I used to paint and draw but I kind of fell off and stopped doing it. I'll get back into that too.,"Oh yeah, nothing is worse than losing joy in something you love doing. But, getting back in an active mindset helps. I used to love to have bonfires, it really was therapeutic for me but then I just lost the will to have them. Since I've been back on MTurk and trying to be more active these last couple weeks, I had one on Saturday and really enjoyed it. So much of the passion lost for hobbies isn't because we grow out of them, it's quite frankly because we are probably just depressed.","Oh wow, that's a lot of effort. I am really sorry to hear that. Hopefully it will help you.",45,3.30719401,27.3083908
162,"I agree fully and I'm happy for you. I think I've been in some sort of depression for some time now. I stopped doing everything I loved. I used to love jogging but I stopped doing that too. I ended up gaining a lot of weight and now I don't like going anywhere or being seen at all. I'm usually 130 and I've shot up to 200. So I think if I can just get my routine down and exercise, I'll be alright.","Yep for sure, just get back at it and learn to love it again.

I would say you should take the class and do it for the long run.,45,2.485316298,12.00491678

It can be a good idea to have them to know you are feeling better.,11,2.769151514,15.94509908
177,I do get paid vacation,Another suggestion that I have is maybe you could take some paid vacation time now rather than later to get away from people for awhile.

Is that an way I could use to get him to want me again?","nobody likes to see that one's friend is sad because of someone else, I think this is an issue that only the two of you can resolve, if he takes you back then his friends will take you back as well, but you need to make sure you want him back","yes, you should not worry too much about what he says.

179,I have never thought of it this way. You are making a lot of good points that I never thought of before. When I think about him I miss the way I felt in terms of being popular. I don't really miss him as a person.,"popularity in my opinion, it's just an opinion (I hope I make sense) but think about how you'd like to be treated and how you want to feel when you are with someone, because at the end of the day it's your feelings and your happiness, I wish you the best of luck.",that's great. are you in a relationship with him?,45,3.204265001,24.63738491

180,"i definitely do not want to end our friendship, that would be even more painful",I didnt end it but we grew apart as people do over the years. We still hang out but it isnt like it was before.
